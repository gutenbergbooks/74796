</p>


<p>In the early spring of 1896, the morning papers
of Washington, and afterwards every journal of any
consequence in the United States, one day contained
the following news item under the glaring headlines:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center medium">SOCIETY BELLE ELOPES.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Vagaries of a Beauty.</span></p>
<hr class="r5">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Daughter of a High Government Official in
Washington, Chief of an Important Bureau.—The
Handsomest Girl in Society.—A Charming
Coquette, Who Has Refused Scores of Eligibles,
Jilts a Distinguished Member of Congress on
the Very Eve of Her Bridal for the Sake of a
Poor Young Journalist, Rolfe Maxwell, Whom
She Secretly Preferred.</p>
</div>

<p>Fashionable society, which expected to get on its
best togs today for the grand noon wedding of Congressman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Desha and the lovely Miss Viola Van Lew,
will stand aghast at learning that the marriage is off.</p>

<p>The young beauty, assuming the prerogative of
woman to change her mind, left her prospective
bridegroom in the lurch last evening, and eloped with
a poor young man not in her set.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony was solemnized last night
at the rectory of All Souls’ Church by the genial rector,
from whom these facts were gleaned by our reporter.
It is understood that the jilted bridegroom is <i>désolé</i>,
and the astonished father furious and unforgiving, but
as the eloping bride inherits on her marriage the fortune
of her deceased mother, she can afford to snap
her jeweled fingers in papa’s irate face.</p>
</div>

<p>Behind this flippant announcement lay a thrilling
romance of beauty, coquetry, love, and pride that may
interest the amiable reader whose heart is yet young
and warm enough to admire the good traits, excuse
the follies, and sympathize with the dire misfortunes
of a beautiful, thoughtless young girl.</p>

<p>If there was any excuse in the world for what Viola
did, it lay in her youth and her thoughtlessness, and
because she did not understand at all what a terrible
force love is at its best or worst.</p>

<p>She had only heard of the grand passion in its lightest
phases as it is pictured by merry young school-girls
boasting to each other of their conquests, and it
was plain to be seen that “the one with the most
strings to her bow” was more envied than any other.
They made “nets, not cages.”</p>

<p>She had the tenderest heart in the world. She would
not have injured the smallest living thing, yet she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
had never heard that love is a flame that burns, and
that one may carry its scars to the grave. They should
have taught her that, those who guided her young life,
for she had the fatal gift of beauty coupled with that
subtle fascination that draws men’s hearts as plants
turn their leaves to the sun.</p>

<p>Slender, lithe, and graceful as a young palm-tree,
with the daintiest patrician hands and feet, piquant
features, rose-leaf complexion, a cloud of scented dark
hair, and a tempting mouth like a rare, red flower, her
eyes alone would have made her lovely without the
aid of other charms. They were large, almond-shaped,
and luminous.</p>

<p>In the shadow they were gray as doves’ wings, in
the sunlight blue as ocean’s deeps, at night they were
dark like the sky, and flashing like the stars, so that
it dazzled you to look at them beneath the thick fringe
of the long black lashes. Then her voice, it was so
sweet and low, and her laugh so musical, how could
any man help but adore?</p>

<p>When she was presented in society there was no one
to equal her in grace and charm. Women wondered
and envied, men raved and adored. She could have
her pick and choice of them all from the multi-millionaire,
the gallant soldier, the haughty diplomat, down to
the gilded youth who aimed to be the glass of fashion
and the mold of form. All alike were Viola Van
Lew’s slaves.</p>

<p>And the lovely, thoughtless creature, trained by indiscreet
advisers to regard all this as simply her due,
flirted demurely while immensely enjoying her conquests,
as what fair maiden of eighteen would not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
when launched on the glittering, effervescent sea of
official life in Washington?</p>

<p>The first man that ever touched her heart was
Florian Gay, a handsome, dashing young fellow of
the cavalier type who would have become a great artist
if he had not been very rich.</p>

<p>He had the divine afflatus, but lacked the incentive
to work that poverty confers on the child of genius.
Owning a handsome studio on a fashionable street, he
trifled with art in a <i>dilettante</i> way, and devoted the
most of his time to society.</p>

<p>He met Viola at a reception, and in due course of
time, to quote an envious rival, “his scalp dangled,
with dozens of others, at her belt.” In return he caught
her fancy, and the flirtation became pronounced. In it
she found a spice of delicious tenderness, a subtle attraction
that she took for love.</p>

<p>He begged to paint Viola’s portrait, and accompanied
by her chaperon—a good-natured old aunt—she
gave him several sittings.</p>

<p>Before the end of the sittings they became engaged,
though Florian secretly chafed at the secrecy she imposed.</p>

<p>“I should like to ask your father and make it public,
so that those other fellows—confound them!—would
quit dangling after you,” he said, betraying a
spice of jealousy inherent in his nature.</p>

<p>But Viola put aside his entreaties.</p>

<p>“I like to have them dangling after me, as you call
it,” she cried, laughingly. “I like to be admired, and
when I am married I wish to be able to say that I had
first refused a hundred suitors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>He could not help crying:</p>

<p>“Heavens, what idle vanity! Have you no mercy
on the men, Viola?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it does not hurt. They soon go away and forget,”
she replied, lightly.</p>

<p>“I do not think that I should soon forget if you had
rejected me. I fancy it would have been a very serious
matter to me,” Florian Gay replied, quite gravely;
but his betrothed only laughed at him.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You would have been courting another
girl next day, Florian.”</p>

<p>“It is more likely that I should have put an end to
my life, for I seem to live only in you, my darling, and
if I were to lose you now after you had promised
yourself to me, I could not answer for myself. I should
commit some desperate deed, I am sure!” he exclaimed,
with such sudden fire and passion that she
started with alarm and queenly displeasure.</p>

<p>“I don’t like stage ranting, please, Florian, and I
can’t abide jealousy. You are to keep our engagement
secret, and not to interfere with my flirtations, as you
promised, or everything will be over between us,”
Viola said, resolutely, heedless of the jealous frown
that lowered upon his handsome brow, and with no
comprehension of his feelings, playing with fire like
a thoughtless child.</p>

<p>A very madness of jealousy throbbed in the young
man’s heart, but it was sternly hidden out of sight as
he cried, eagerly:</p>

<p>“I will obey your wishes, Viola; but won’t you tell
me when you will be willing to marry me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not for ages yet, Florian. Remember, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
not nineteen yet, and have only been out in society a
year. My judgment is scarcely formed now, and perhaps,”
with an arch, sidelong glance from her dazzling
eyes, “I may yet see another man I could like better
and throw you over for his sake.”</p>

<p>“Woe be unto him at that hour!” the distracted
lover muttered grimly between his teeth; but Viola did
not overhear. She did not, in fact, apprehend any
change in her constancy to Florian. She had simply
been teasing him to test her power, and now she said,
with a sudden, sweet smile:</p>

<p>“Poor auntie will wake up presently over there in
her corner and think it is time to have this sitting over,
yet you have hardly begun. Please go on.”</p>

<p>Florian took up the brush obediently, but his hand
was unsteady with the hot throbbings of his jealous
heart. He longed to kiss her now that she had granted
him that sweet, tender smile, but she seldom permitted
a caress, she was so proudly coy.</p>

<p>“Ah, Viola, how hard it is to paint you! Such
beauty can not be transferred to canvas!” he sighed.
“I am getting out of heart with my work, and the
poet’s lines, ‘In an Atelier,’ often occur to me.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Ah, dearest, I am sick at heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It is so little I can do—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I talk my jargon—live for art—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’d much prefer to live for you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How dull and lifeless colors are!</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>Viola laughed and rose.</p>

<p>“Well, I can not stay any longer today, because
auntie and I are going to the White House reception
now. Will you come with us, Florian?”</p>

<p>“Delighted I am sure, but an engagement prevents.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you break it?”</p>

<p>“Not with this man, much as I would like to for the
sake of going with you. But I’ve been badgering him
ever since he came to Congress for a few sittings, and
he has at last promised to begin this day—in fact, this
very hour.”</p>

<p>“Who is my important rival?”</p>

<p>“Professor Desha.”</p>

<p>Viola instantly made a rosy <i>moue</i> of disdain, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I hate that man! He is too goody-goody!”</p>

<p>“He is a very noble and upright man, and I am particularly
anxious to paint his portrait. His fine head
and face remind me somewhat of the old masters’ pictures
of Christ!” exclaimed Florian Gay, warmly.</p>

<p>“You are partial to him because he was your professor
at college,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but it is because that gave me an opportunity
to know his value better. Philip Desha is
a noble fellow, with grand principles and high ideals,
and I am sorry that he yielded to ambition and let his
people elect him to Congress. Politics will prove a
severe test to his upright character,” he answered
with more seriousness than he usually displayed.</p>

<p>“Come, auntie, we must be going,” cried Viola, pettishly,
waking up her aunt, and taking an abrupt leave
in her fear of meeting her lover’s next sitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>But she did encounter him coming up the steps, a
very dignified looking man of medium size, and about
thirty years old, with as the artist had remarked, a
grave, noble, serene countenance much like the ideal
heads of Christ.</p>

<p>They bowed to each other with marked <i>hauteur</i>, and
Viola passed on to her waiting carriage.</p>

<p>Viola had a secret grudge against Professor Desha,
but it was so childish, she would have been ashamed to
let any one know it.</p>

<p>She was piqued at him because he was the only man
she knew who appeared quite indifferent to her charms.</p>

<p>In fact, a spiteful rival had told her that he had
expressed himself strongly as holding coquettes in
lively detestation.</p>

<p>“He is a simpleton, and nothing would please me
better than to break his heart!” exclaimed Viola, scornfully;
but whether the young congressman ever heard
of this wicked speech or not, he did not give her the
chance she wished. He held himself coldly and disapprovingly
aloof, and paid attention “to the homeliest
girls he met,” so Viola said, “wall-flowers that no
one else would look at twice.”</p>

<p>Consequently, she came to have a secret angry interest
in the delinquent while pretending to hold him
in profound contempt.</p>

<p>She knew that he had a noble nature, as Florian
said, and that he cherished high ideals. He was good
to look at, too, in his blonde type, with his fair hair
and beard, and large clear blue eyes, and frank, kindly
expression. But Viola would never have thought of
him twice if he had fallen at her feet like the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>He excited her interest by his own astonishing indifference,
and she had many speculations over it,
always ending by the explanation that very likely he
had a sweetheart in the State he had come from up
North—“some goody-goody nonentity like himself.”</p>

<p>She was rather vexed that Florian was fond of him,
and was going to paint his portrait, for she might have
to meet him at the studio sometimes. Well, she would
find out the days he was to come, and stay away herself
at those hours.</p>

<p>So her bow, when they passed each other on the
steps, was even more cold and uplifted than usual.</p>

<p>“He shall see how little I care for him,” she
thought, with a pride that sent the hot blood mantling
warmly to her cheek.</p>

<p>She stepped quickly into the carriage, and gentle
old Aunt Edwina said:</p>

<p>“What a noble face and head Professor Desha has!
Don’t you admire him, Viola?”</p>

<p>“No, not at all,” the young girl answered, huffily.</p>

<p>But in spite of her resolve not to meet her <i>bête
noire</i> at the studio again, she encountered him there
twice the next week. It was all by the merest chance,
for how was she to know what hour he chose for his
sittings?</p>

<p>On both of these occasions Viola had perforce to
make herself agreeable to the young congressman, for
she did not like to offend Florian by a contrary course.
So she remained a short while on each call, and she
pretended a simple friendliness with Professor Desha.
He had to acknowledge to himself that she was fascinating,
yet he could not say that he had observed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
least coquetry in her manner, the least effort to win
his admiration. Perhaps, he said to himself, she did
not consider him worth her while. He knew that
Florian Gay’s heart was at her feet, and supposed that
this would afford her sufficient present amusement.</p>

<p>Yet he looked forward with secret pleasure to meeting
her again at the studio. How beautiful she had
looked in the rich artistic room, and how much more
womanly and sweet she had appeared than when in
social circles surrounded by the inevitable group of
admirers!</p>

<p>But he did not meet her at the studio again.</p>

<p>The sittings for the portraits came to an abrupt
end.</p>

<p>Florian Gay came unexpectedly one day to call upon
his betrothed.</p>

<p>He was pale and agitated. She saw at once that
he had received bad news.</p>

<p>A cablegram from his aged mother had conveyed
the news that his father had suffered a stroke of
paralysis at Carlsbad Springs, whither he had gone
a few months previous for his health.</p>

<p>They had anxiously desired to have Florian accompany
them, but his passion for Viola had made him
refuse. He could not tear himself away from the
land that held his idol. He remained, and was rewarded
by Viola’s acceptance of his suit.</p>

<p>But now he must acquiesce in his mother’s entreaty
for his presence by the couch of his dying father. He
must go, and there was no telling how long he might
be obliged to stay, paralysis was such an uncertain
disease. The invalid might die before he reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Germany, or he might linger for months. He might
even get well again.</p>

<p>Florian was deeply grieved, and most anxious to
go to his father; but the pain of leaving Viola tore his
jealous heart like a keen knife.</p>

<p>She was so capricious that she might forget him
while he was gone. She might find some one she
loved better and throw him over, as she had once
gayly threatened.</p>

<p>The anguish of the thought almost took his breath
away.</p>

<p>He determined on a bold step. He would entreat
her to consent to a quiet marriage and go abroad with
him.</p>

<p>“If she loves me half as well as I love her she will
be willing to do as I wish, rather than face a separation
of uncertain duration,” he said to himself, and
plunged boldly into the subject, encouraged by the dismay
and sympathy with which she received his news.</p>

<p>“You will miss me a little, Viola, my darling?” he
cried, eagerly, when he saw the bright eyes softened
with the dew of tears.</p>

<p>“More than a little, dear Florian!” she cried,
warmly, for her really tender heart was softened by
his grief. It pained her, too, to have him go away like
this. There was no one else whose society was half so
agreeable.</p>

<p>Taking quick advantage of her tender admissions,
he plunged into the subject nearest his heart, begging
her to marry him tonight or tomorrow and go with
him abroad.</p>

<p>Viola was speechless at first with astonishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
When she caught her breath, she refused promptly.</p>

<p>“I thought you pretended to love me,” he cried, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“So I do, Florian, very dearly, but not enough to
marry you offhand without a <i>trousseau</i>.”</p>

<p>“Bother the <i>trousseau</i>! You would order it from
Paris, anyway, so you can get it just as easily when
we go over.”</p>

<p>“I am not ready to be married yet, Florian, <i>trousseau</i>
or no <i>trousseau</i>. I don’t want to be married so
young.”</p>

<p>“But, darling, how long do you expect me to wait?”</p>

<p>“Until I choose to name the day, sir, and if you get
too impatient, you are welcome to take back your freedom,”
saucily.</p>

<p>“Oh, Viola, I should never wish to do that!” he
groaned, clasping her little jeweled hand and pressing
his hot lips upon it while he continued: “Viola, I may
be absent for months, and I shall go mad with jealousy
of the fortunate men who will be near you, who can
feast their eyes on your beauty and hear your sweet
voice and rippling laughter. Oh, are you sure, quite
sure, that your love will last while I am gone, that you
will be true to your promise?”</p>

<p>“If you can not trust my love, if you are beginning
to doubt me already, we had better break off now!”
she cried, spiritedly.</p>

<p>“My beautiful love, how can you torture me so
when I am already so unhappy?” groaned Florian.</p>

<p>“Then why will you be so silly? Do you not know
that I have never loved any one but you, Florian, and
never shall?” cried Viola, rashly, melted to tenderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
by his grief and really feeling very sad indeed over his
going, so that she took a very lukewarm emotion for
eternal love.</p>

<p>Florian was transported with joy over her fond
declaration, and again renewed his entreaties for an
immediate marriage, but was soon warned off by her
rising vexation.</p>

<p>“I must go and make my preparations for leaving
at once,” he said, sadly, rising. “Oh, Viola, it breaks
my heart to leave you, my precious one! Will you
promise to write to me often if I am detained long?”
pleadingly.</p>

<p>“I am not fond of writing letters, dear, but I will
try not to neglect you while you are gone. If they
are very short, you must not mind, because I am so
busy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Busy!</i>” he echoed, with slight sarcasm, and she
flushed slightly, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Why will you take one up so? You know the demands
of a social life are very pressing. But I dare
say I shall not enjoy myself at all now, I shall be missing
you so much,” her voice breaking and tears actually
brimming over in her eyes.</p>

<p>Florian caught her in his fond arms and kissed them
away. Then they had such a sad leave-taking that the
emotional girl allowed her betrothed to persuade her
to name the wedding-day as soon as he should return
from abroad.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE MOTH AND THE STAR.</p>


<p>Florian, hurrying away with sad heart and dejected
mien from the parting with Viola, stopped short at
meeting Professor Desha strolling leisurely toward
him. He stared at him in surprise, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Well met, my friend, for I was going home to
send you a message.”</p>

<p>“A message?”</p>

<p>“Yes—that I can not go on with the portrait just
now. I am called most unexpectedly abroad.”</p>

<p>“Something is wrong?” cried the congressman, who
had not failed to observe the pallor of his friend’s
face.</p>

<p>“Yes; my father is paralyzed at Carlsbad, and
mother has cabled me to start to her at once. I shall
go on tonight to New York, and sail on the first
steamer.” After a moment’s embarrassing pause, he
added: “I have been calling on Miss Van Lew—to tell
her we must leave off the sittings until my return, and
to—bid her farewell.”</p>

<p>His voice was so wrung with emotion that it sounded
strange in his own ears, for an almost unconquerable
impulse had come over him to confide to this loyal
friend the story of his betrothal to Viola and his distress
at the separation.</p>

<p>Had he yielded to the temptation how much of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
pain and tragedy of the future might have been spared
both their hearts!</p>

<p>But he was a man of honor, and he remembered just
in time his promise to Viola to keep secret their engagement.</p>

<p>He crushed back the words struggling for utterance
on his lips, and said instead:</p>

<p>“I can not tell how long I may be absent—not long,
if I can help it—but of course it will depend on the
duration of my father’s illness. Do not forget that
I shall hope to resume the sittings for your portrait
as soon as I return. Now, I must hurry away. Good-bye,”
and he held out his hand.</p>

<p>Professor Desha grasped it heartily with many expressions
of sympathy and good will, and they parted
thus in the cold air of December, not to meet again
for several months, and then under the lowering
shadow of tragic circumstances.</p>

<p>Desha had seen his friend coming down the steps of
the Van Lew mansion, and he had drawn his own conclusions.</p>

<p>It did not seem to him that even the news of his
father’s seizure was sufficient to bring that despairing
look to Florian Gay’s handsome face. He said to
himself:</p>

<p>“He adored that beautiful coquette, and has long
been hovering between hope and fear. Now he has
put his fate to the test, and been rejected, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>He was on his way to call on Viola himself, though
he had not mentioned the fact to Florian in the haste
of their parting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The pretext for the visit was to get Viola to join
a skating-party tomorrow to consist of his cousin—a
gay society dame—and some other beaus and belles,
the latter of whom Professor Desha had been sent by
the aforesaid cousin to interview on the subject of
their willingness.</p>

<p>He could not have explained to himself why he
decided to call on Miss Van Lew first of all. He admired
her beauty, to be sure, but he detested her coquetry,
and a wave of indignation passed over him as
he thought of how she had trifled with Florian’s heart,
only to reject him in the end.</p>

<p>“No doubt I shall find her as gay and smiling as if
she did not realize at all that another broken heart
lies at her door,” he thought, as he mounted the steps.</p>

<p>Viola started with surprise when his card was
brought up to her room.</p>

<p>“Tell him I will be down immediately,” she exclaimed,
hurrying to her mirror to remove the traces
of the tears she had shed over Florian’s departure.</p>

<p>Then she made a few effective additions to her
already elegant morning toilet, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“I must be quite gay, and not let any one suspect
how my heart aches over Florian’s going. Dear fellow,
how fondly he loves me, and how hard it was
for him to leave me! I love him dearly, but I would
not have our engagement known for the world, for
then I would have to wear the willow all during his
absence, and perhaps never get another offer. Dear
me, I wonder who will be the next one? Suppose—only
suppose—” She laughed saucily to herself, and
the daring wish chased away every sad thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Florian, so that she was quite radiant in her welcome
of her visitor, and he could read no slightest sign of
emotion on the sparkling, <i>riante</i> face.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you know that we shall have no more sittings
now for our portraits?” she cried. “Mr. Gay
has just left here—perhaps you met him going out?
He came to tell me that he is summoned to Europe by
the illness of his father.”</p>

<p>Not a break in the sweet clear voice; so well did
she play her part of indifference towards the lover for
whom she secretly grieved. No one must guess that,
lest she lose the chance of winning new victims.</p>

<p>Professor Desha thought, indignantly:</p>

<p>“How heartless—and how beautiful!”</p>

<p>Aloud he answered, deliberately:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry for Florian. I met him going
away. Until he told me about his father I believed
from his woe-begone face that you had given him his
<i>congé</i>.”</p>

<p>It was almost a point-blank question, so intently did
his large, honest blue eyes search her face, making
her blush up to the edges of her wavy dark hair, while
the long fringe of her lashes swept the rich damask
of her cheek as she cried, with a forced, uneasy laugh:</p>

<p>“You do me injustice indeed. I was very sorry to
have him go away. We are great friends, Florian and
I, and I’m afraid I am going to miss him very much.”</p>

<p>Her candor only made him more certain of his
conclusions. He felt quite positive that Florian had
been refused, hence his pallor and dejection, and her
gay indifference. There was no pensive cast on her
white brow, such as one wears for the parting from a
dear friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>But he could not pursue the subject any further, so
he stated the object of his call. His cousin, Mrs. Wellford,
wished to have her join a skating-party the next
morning, the party to lunch with her afterward. Would
she come?</p>

<p>Viola thought of her lovely new skating suit, rich
violet velvet trimmed with Russian sable, and rejoiced
in her heart at such an opportunity to display it; but
she cast down her eyes demurely, and appeared to
reflect until he added, encouragingly:</p>

<p>“I will call for you at ten o’clock if you will permit
me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I shall be glad,” she replied, frankly;
and then he hurried away, almost frightened at himself
for having impulsively offered her his escort, and half
pleased, half repentant.</p>

</p>


<p>Viola did not lose much sleep over Florian’s going
that night, for a pleasant excitement had been mixed
with her thoughts by Philip Desha’s unexpected call,
and her engagement with him for tomorrow.</p>

<p>She thought, mischievously:</p>

<p>“He is putting himself in my power, and no man
has resisted me yet when I chose to exercise it. What
fun to lead him on a little just to pay him out for
detesting flirts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>When he called for her promptly at ten the next
morning, she was quite ready to go, and he started
with delight as she came down the steps, her beauty
and her costume were alike so flawless, while her
bright smile seemed to shed sunshine upon the cold,
wintry day.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steps a beggar had paused with
outstretched hand and a piteous whine—a poor woman
with an emaciated, half-starved babe clutched to her
breast.</p>

<p>Viola paused and gazed at the wretched mendicants,
the miserable young mother with her pinched face and
unkept garb, and the poor infant with its half-clothed
body, and blue, half-frozen toes peeping through
ragged hose.</p>

<p>Large pitying tears flashed into the girl’s beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>Philip Desha thought he had never seen such a contrast
in human life as the wretched, starving beggars
and the beautiful, happy heiress. He slipped his
fingers into his vest pocket for money, but Viola was
quicker than he, she had already drawn out her tiny,
silk-netted purse and taken from it a shining gold coin,
which she pressed into the baby’s skinny little claw,
saying in a voice that trembled with sympathy:</p>

<p>“There now, tell mamma to buy it a cloak and a
pair of shoes, and something to eat.”</p>

<p>Philip pressed his silver dollar into the woman’s
eager hand, and she burst into tearful thanks and
praises.</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t thank us; thank God for putting it
into our hearts to help you,” Viola murmured, gently,
as she turned away to the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Professor Desha helped her in, and closed the door.
His heart thrilled with sudden admiration, not so
much at the charity, for he knew she could afford it,
but at the tender pity and sympathy that had gone
with the gift.</p>

<p>To his noble heart Viola had looked more beautiful
with those tender tears softening the brilliance of her
eyes than when sparkling with diamonds in some gala
scene she had moved the cynosure of admiring glances.
He thought:</p>

<p>“She has a true womanly heart in spite of her
coquetry.”</p>

<p>They drove to his cousin’s home, where they were
joined directly by a gay party of a dozen or so accomplished
skaters, eager for the sport. Directly they
sought the beautiful Potomac, whose glassy surface
glittered clear as crystal beneath the deep blue sky and
fitful sunshine of a cold and perfect winter day.</p>

<p>Viola was an accomplished skater and dearly loved
the exercise. She appeared more beautiful upon the
ice than in a ball-room. Her perfect complexion
glowed with enchanting color, and her luminous eyes
caught a peculiar deep blue like the ocean’s waves,
her soft, musical laugh disclosed little teeth like rows
of pearls between perfect scarlet lips that it would
have been Heaven to kiss.</p>

<p>Very naturally she and Desha paired off together,
as he, too, was an excellent skater, and soon the bright
surface of the river was the scene of exhilarating sport
that drew hundreds of gazers to the banks to gaze at
the merry crowd, while among them appeared reporters,
with their pencils busy taking notes and sketches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of the doings of gay society for their respective papers.</p>

<p>Viola was very happy, but now and then a regretful
thought of Florian intruded on her gayety like a
breath blown upon the clear surface of a sparkling
mirror.</p>

<p>“Poor, dear Florian! I wish that he was here with
me now. He would enjoy this so much. And how
sad he must feel, going away today for such an uncertain
absence when we were so happy in our love.
Perhaps I ought not to be so gay while he is so sad.
But then I dare not give way to moping, lest some
one suspect our engagement,” she thought, self-excusingly,
and turned a radiant face on her companion,
answering a remark he was making about one of the
young girls who was just learning to skate and had
suffered several falls, to the amusement of her companions
and her own chagrin.</p>

<p>“It is too bad, poor thing! And then her partner
is not very skillful either. Now if she had you to
teach her—” began Viola, delicately hinting for him to
go and help the poor girl.</p>

<p>Desha was loth to leave his charming companion.
Her subtle charm was beginning to enthrall him as it
had done others. He regretted that he had drawn
her attention to the other girl.</p>

<p>But she added, coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Do go and teach the poor thing how to keep on her
feet. I feel so sorry for her forlorn plight. There
now, she has tumbled down again!” laughing in spite
of herself.</p>

<p>“Remember, I shall not stay away from you long,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
he answered, as he tore himself away to do her bidding.</p>

<p>“Suppose you skate awhile with me, Miss Hyer,”
he said, smilingly, to the young girl, who accepted
with delight, for he and Viola had been the observed
of all observers.</p>

<p>Viola, left to herself, began to do some very graceful
figures on the ice that she had learned while wintering
in Canada two years before.</p>

<p>Hundreds of admiring eyes watched her with wonder
and delight. But glancing back to see how Desha
was progressing with his pupil, she observed Miss
Hyer’s former clumsy partner making the best speed
he could in her direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, that stupid! I’ll escape him if I have to
skate across the river,” she pouted, in dismay, and
struck out for the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Directly a cry of horror rose on the air as the
gliding form rushed upon thin ice that cracked beneath
its weight. There was an answering cry of
deadly fear, a gleam of violet velvet and shining fur,
and Viola’s form sank from view beneath the treacherous
breaking ice into the deep, ingulfing waves.</p>

<p class="center">THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.</p>


<p>Sudden as a thunderbolt from a clear sky was the
change that came over the gay party of skaters and
the applauding spectators as they echoed the loud,
horrified shriek of Viola crashing through the thin
ice and disappearing into the depths of the river below.</p>

<p>The faces but a moment ago so gay and laughing,
paled with grief and terror, and a terrible panic arose,
all the skaters pressing forward toward the hole in
the ice, the crowd on the shore also venturing out
pell-mell, till the crystal sheet began to tremble with
their heavy weight. Some fell down, and were
trampled in the mad rush of others, and a dreadful loss
of life seemed imminent, when all at once there rang
out, high over every other sound, a loud, thrilling,
masculine voice, crying authoritatively:</p>

<p>“Go back, all of you! Do you not feel the ice
trembling? Directly it will break with your weight,
and hundreds be drowned! Be warned, and return to
the shore, leaving only such men as will assist in saving
the young lady!”</p>

<p>The exodus for the shore began as suddenly as it
had rushed the other way just now, reason being excited
in the startled mass of surging people. And they
were none too quick, for the ice began to crack ominously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
before it was cleared of all save Professor
Desha and a few other men, foremost among them
the tall stranger whose voice of command had driven
back the terror-stricken mob.</p>

<p>This man had evidently been simply a spectator, for
he wore no skates, but he was rapidly sliding toward
the scene of the accident, and following him at some
distance was Desha, whose speed had been greatly retarded
by the hysterical clinging of his partner, Miss
Hyer, whom he could not shake off till he thrust her
into the hands of another man, crying, as he darted
away:</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, take care of her! I must save
Miss Van Lew!”</p>

<p>Heaven alone knew the frenzy of his thoughts as
he skated swiftly toward the middle of the river, reckless
of aught save that he should save Viola from
drowning.</p>

<p>But the stranger who had routed the crowd was
before him. He threw off his coat and dropped down
flat on the broken ice, peering carefully down into the
water.</p>

<p>The next minute he dived over the ragged, splintered
edge, and disappeared from view, while the sight of
such gallant daring evoked a swelling cry of admiration
from the shore, men cheering to the echo, women
and children bursting into tears, for there seemed little
chance of either life being saved from the deadly
current beneath the ice.</p>

<p>Questions ran from lip to lip.</p>

<p>“Who is the splendid fellow, anyway?”</p>

<p>But no one could answer that question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Every one knew directly who the girl was—Miss
Van Lew, the beautiful heiress, daughter of the chief
of an important bureau—but no one there had ever
seen the young hero before.</p>

<p>He was handsome as a king, fine, and soldierly looking,
with a ringing voice of command; but not a soul
knew his name, though many a silent prayer went up
that he might be saved, together with the beautiful girl
for whom he had risked his life.</p>

<p>Professor Desha and three others now came in for
the next round of cheers as they reached the fatal
spot, and cautiously prostrated themselves on the ice
to gaze down into the depths.</p>

<p>They raised their voices then in shouts of joy, for
the sight they saw filled their hearts with gladness.</p>

<p>The icy current had not swept away the victims, as
they dreaded. There was the hero keeping himself
up in the water by a terrific exercise of skill and
strength, while he supported on one arm the limp
form of Viola, whose pallid face and closed eyes
looked like death.</p>

<p>“Courage! courage!” they cried to him, and reached
eager arms to their aid, first taking out Viola, and then
her gallant rescuer, who gasped, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“You were not a minute too soon. It was so freezing
cold in the water I could not have sustained myself
long with such a dead weight on my arm, and the
current rushing so fast!”</p>

<p>“You are a hero, my dear fellow!” cried Desha,
admiringly, as they set out across the ice, bearing
Viola’s limp form, fearing that death had already
claimed the beautiful creature for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>A physician was fortunately on the spot, and placing
her in a carriage, accompanied by Mrs. Wellford
and Professor Desha, he took her home.</p>

<p>When others turned to do a like kindness to the
gallant rescuer, he had disappeared.</p>

<p>“What has become of him?” they cried; and several
answered at once:</p>

<p>“He just beckoned a cab, jumped in, and was driven
away, refusing to answer any questions.”</p>

<p>And strange to say, not one in that crowd knew
his name or anything about him. He was quite strange
to them all. And the reporters, in graphically describing
the affair for the evening papers, could only refer
to him as “the handsome and mysterious rescuer of
Miss Van Lew from a watery grave, the unknown
hero,” etc., while earnestly requesting him to announce
himself to a curious and admiring public.</p>

<p>Later on Viola’s father appeared in print, thanking
the unknown savior of his daughter’s life, and begging
the favor of his acquaintance; but no reply came to
any of these overtures—the man’s identity remained
as deeply hidden as if he had sunk forever under the
swirling waves of the deep river from which he had
rescued Viola.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our heroine being taken home and resuscitated
with difficulty from her unconscious condition,
was quite ill for a week, from the shock and
wetting she had received.</p>

<p>She knew nothing of the stranger who had snatched
her back to life as she was sinking a second time beneath
the cold waves, for she was unconscious when
he grasped her; but as she began to convalesce, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
heard from Aunt Edwina the story of her rescue, she
became greatly interested in her unknown savior.</p>

<p>“Oh, how stupid it was in everybody not to find out
his name! I shall never be happy till I know him and
can thank him for saving my life!” she cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>Wise Aunt Edwina presently began to grow uneasy
over her niece’s anxiety about the handsome unknown.
She said to herself:</p>

<p>“Come; this will not do. If she ever finds him out
she will be falling in love with him, the silly, romantic
child, and as like as not, he may be some handsome
ne’er-do-well not fit for her to speak to, so I will disenchant
her if I can.”</p>

<p>And the next time Viola began to dilate on her
anxiety to know her rescuer, she cleared her throat,
the dear, shy old lady, and observed, gently:</p>

<p>“My dear, I wouldn’t harp too much on my rescuer
if I were you. I have a shrewd suspicion why he does
not disclose himself.”</p>

<p>“What reason could he have, dear Aunt Edwina?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, every one who has described him calls
him tall and dark—they always dwell particularly on
the <i>dark</i>—so maybe—mind, I only say maybe—he
was one of those handsome young mulatto men.”</p>

<p>Viola’s eyes flashed disapprobation, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“But that is no reason he should hide himself—he
was a hero all the same. And you know papa would
reward him handsomely if he would accept it.”</p>

<p>“Probably he does not need it, or perhaps he is
married and doesn’t wish to make his wife jealous
by letting her know he risked his life to save a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
young girl,” pursued Aunt Edwina, relentlessly throwing
cold water on Viola’s romance.</p>

<p>Viola pouted indignantly and dropped the subject,
for dread of ridicule was her weak point, as her relative
well knew.</p>

<p>At the end of a week she received a tender love
letter from Florian, written during the days on ship-board
and mailed at Queenstown. It was so fond, and
couched in such beautiful phrases, interspersed with
love poems, that it warmed Viola’s heart, that had
not wandered to him often in his absence, being distracted
by her illness and thoughts of the unknown
savior of her life.</p>

<p>“Dear fellow, how much he loves me, and how distracted
he will be when I write him all that has happened
to me since he went away!” she thought; and
not to spare him the sensation, she wrote the next day
a full account of it, not forgetting the handsome
stranger, of whom she said:</p>

<p>“I do so long to know him; but, after all, perhaps
it is better not, for I am so romantic I might fall in
love with him and forget all about you, you know.
But that is only fun, for of course I could never care
for any one else as I do for you, dear Florian.”</p>

<p>She actually believed this herself, and smiled as she
reread it, thinking:</p>

<p>“How it will please him to read those words!”</p>

<p>They were the only words of love in the letter, for
she had so much news to tell, including this item:</p>

<p>“You will be glad to hear that I like your goody-goody
friend much better than I did when you were
here. He has been very kind and attentive, sending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
to inquire about me every day, and yesterday sent
beautiful flowers and a kind note, regretting so much
it was not he who had saved my life instead of a
stranger, and saying he would have been first to the
rescue but for that aggravating Minnie Hyer clinging
to him in hysterics and holding him back, till he actually
pushed her into another man’s arms and escaped
to assist me. You see, I am answering your letter
right away, Florian, though I am propped up with
pillows in bed; but I knew you would be anxious to
hear from me and interested in—everything.”</p>

<p>When this entertaining letter reached Florian at
Carlsbad, where he had found his father very low but
still alive, the poor fellow was indeed almost distracted
at hearing of his sweetheart’s narrow escape
from death. He longed passionately, impatiently, to
fly back to her side; but it was impossible to desert
his sorrowing mother and slowly dying father.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, my darling, if only you would
have come with me!” he groaned, as he read and reread
the dear letter, hungering for words of tenderness
of which he found so few.</p>

<p>It dawned on him presently that half her letter had
been devoted to Professor Desha and her unknown
rescuer.</p>

<p>“Confound them both!” he muttered, jealously,
crossing out with pencil all the offending lines, and
leaving only what referred to herself.</p>

<p>When Viola was well enough to receive callers
again, Professor Desha was among the first announced.</p>

<p>Since the day of her accident his heart had been in
a tumult of emotion.</p>

<p>He had realized that the interest he took in the fair
coquette was deep and painful—painful because he
deemed it no less than a calamity to lose his heart to
one like Viola, who only played at love, and seemed
to have no conception of its depth and sacredness.</p>

<p>Although he was in his dignified way a very attractive
man, he did not have enough personal vanity to
suppose that he could succeed in winning her heart
where so many others had failed—even Florian Gay,
so young and handsome, and much richer than himself.</p>

<p>So while she lay ill he began to read his own heart
in dismay, and entered on a struggle with the passion
that had stolen on him unawares, bursting into full
flower that tragic day when she had gone down so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
swiftly through the broken ice into the black, flowing
river to what might so quickly have been cruel death.</p>

<p>She filled his whole heart and thoughts, and he
stood aghast at his own weakness and folly.</p>

<p>Time was, but a little while ago, that he had frankly
despised and avoided her in his detestation of her
heartlessness.</p>

<p>But the few unavoidable meetings with her at the
studio of Florian Gay had removed the keen edge of
his dislike. No one could be in Viola’s company and
not yield to the magnetic charm of her presence. After
all, she seemed but a simple, unaffected girl, perhaps
not realizing the harm she did by her gayety and
beauty.</p>

<p>So love had come to him against his will, and he
chafed bitterly under it, feeling that the light coquette
was not worthy the sacrifice of a true man’s heart.</p>

<p>He determined to conquer his ill-starred passion as
speedily as possible, and never let Viola have the
triumph of knowing she had ever touched his heart.</p>

<p>While she was ill he did not succeed very well in his
desire, because pity and sympathy softened his feelings.</p>

<p>Then when she began to convalesce, it made him so
glad he could not resist a kind little note and some
flowers. It seemed an almost necessary courtesy, and
he intended to stop right there, and never see her
again if he could avoid it.</p>

<p>But Viola sent him a sweet little perfumed note in
reply, at the end of which she said:</p>

<p>“I am almost well again, and indeed you must not
blame yourself for having left me alone on the ice that
day, because I sent you, you know, to help poor Minnie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Hyer. I pitied her so much, poor thing! tumbling
about on the ice till she must have been black and
blue with bruises. Then, of course, you never thought
of my skating out so far alone—neither did I, indeed—but
I’ll tell you why I did it when I see you again.”</p>

<p>Much brooding over the last sentence persuaded him
that he owed Viola a duty call.</p>

<p>Evidently she expected it, and—besides, his curiosity
was aroused. What reason had she had for
skating out so far indeed?</p>

<p>“I will go—just once. Then I must certainly put
the little beauty out of my thoughts. One can not
play with fire. I must give myself up to my political
duties and abjure society,” he decided, grimly.</p>

<p>So he set out for his last call, and when ushered
into her charming presence, the young statesman of
thirty—cool and self-possessed enough ordinarily—trembled
so that he could scarcely speak, so keen was
his delight at seeing her again.</p>

<p>Viola had known well that he would come. She
had faith in the potency of those well-chosen words,
“when I see you again.”</p>

<p>She smiled him a cordial welcome, and it seemed
to him that never before had she looked so lovely.</p>

<p>Illness had softened down the exuberant vitality of
her beauty, stealing a little roundness and bloom from
her cheek, and a little of the mischief from her luminous
eyes. There was a delicate, appealing languor in
her movements, aided by the trailing house-gown
whose warm red tints contrasted so well with her
fairness.</p>

<p>“You will pardon me for half reclining among my
cushions. I am not strong yet,” she explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Only lazy, professor,” bantered Aunt Edwina, who
then went on with her fancy-work in an absent-minded
way, as if she had almost forgotten his presence.</p>

<p>Viola set herself to be charming, and presently he
overcame his seizure of timidity, that she took in
some alarm for indifference.</p>

<p>“I am trying all I can to forget that day; but, oh!
I dream of it every night, and, oh! I don’t think that
I can ever be the same careless, light-hearted girl
again!” she cried, shuddering. “I shall never forget
my sensations as I plunged through the ice, down,
down, down to the bottom of the river, believing that
I was going to my death. I was wondering if I
should go to Heaven, for I did not think I had been
such a bad girl, only a bit vain, maybe.”</p>

<p>“A bit vain,” he echoed, wondering if all her coquetries
lay so lightly on her conscience.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been vain, and I remembered it then,”
conceded Viola, demurely. “I have believed people
when they told me I was pretty, and I rejoiced in
exciting admiration. Only that morning I admired
myself so much in my new skating suit, and thought
what a sensation I should create on the ice. But oh,
how I repented everything when I went crashing
through into the cold water! Oh, how good God was
to send some one to save me! I shall try to be a better
girl the rest of my life!” she added, seriously, her
eyes growing soft with the dew of threatening tears.</p>

<p>Aunt Edwina was listening, though she seemed so
busy, for she interposed and said:</p>

<p>“You know, dear, Doctor Herron said you must not
permit your mind to dwell on the shock of that accident.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
He says it will make you nervous if you don’t
put it out of your mind.”</p>

<p>“But, auntie, it seems to me that I ought to keep
it in mind always so as to be a better girl, for indeed
I mean to be hereafter,” objected Viola, with the most
charming humility.</p>

<p>“Pshaw, child, you’ve always been sweet and good
with one exception—you flirt too much. But I don’t
suppose you can help that any more than you can help
breathing. It was born in you, and maybe it doesn’t
do much harm,” returned the old lady, quite forgetting
Desha’s presence.</p>

<p>Viola blushed up to the edges of her silky dark hair
and stole a glance at him.</p>

<p>“I wish that <i>you</i> could judge me as kindly,” she
murmured, almost entreatingly.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Lew!” deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know the things you have said about me.
Other girls too good to flirt,” bitterly, “weren’t too
good to repeat them to me,” defiantly.</p>

<p>“Miss Van Lew, I beg your pardon. You see that
was before I knew you,” he hastened to explain, abjectly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgive you. I don’t bear malice,” she returned,
sunnily.</p>

<p>“Yet I heard that you had threatened to break my
heart,” teasingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not mean it. I wouldn’t if I could—not
that I ever expect to have the chance,” she returned,
somewhat incoherently, her cheeks flaming under his
steady gaze.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” he said, lightly; but the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
chafed him. He changed it by saying, “You
promised to tell me why you ventured so imprudently
far on the ice that day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” and she began to laugh. “It was this
way: I saw Minnie Hyer’s partner skating out toward
me. He was almost as clumsy as Minnie, and I said
to myself: ‘I will not be bothered with that great
gawk if I have to skate across the Potomac to escape
him!’ So I went flying, and—suddenly I heard the
ice cracking with my weight and realized my danger.
I started to go back, but the thin ice broke, and—oh!”
cried Viola, hiding her suddenly blanched face in her
tiny white hands.</p>

<p>“Do not think of it any more,” he said, remembering
her aunt’s caution.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must!” she cried, impulsively. “And I
haven’t told you yet how anxious I am to know the
name of the hero who saved my life. I am so anxious
to thank him and to have papa reward him handsomely—if
he would accept it.”</p>

<p>“I should imagine he would be glad of a reward—or
that he needed it. He was not particularly well
dressed, though as handsome as a prince, and as brave
as a hero,” Professor Desha replied.</p>

<p>“Poor and proud,” commented Aunt Edwina.</p>

<p>“And you have no slightest idea as to his identity?”
Viola cried, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest; and I am sorry, for I would like
to know such a brave man better. He told me you
were sinking for the second time when he dived after
you,” returned Desha, generously, though a spasm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
pain contracted his heart at her interest in the handsome
unknown.</p>

<p>But he could not blame her at all. It would have
appeared most ungrateful if she had not taken any interest.</p>

<p>He began to think of going, but still he lingered,
feasting his eyes on her lovely pale face that he was
promising himself never to see again.</p>

<p>She began to ask him about the gayeties she had
missed during her illness, and it gave him the opportunity
he desired of saying that he had attended few
social functions lately. His time had been occupied
with congressional duties, and he had resolved to
eschew the delights of society.</p>

<p>“That is too bad,” Viola exclaimed; and it seemed
to him as if there was genuine regret in her tones and
in the quick glance of her soft eyes.</p>

<p>He wondered, with a furious throb at his heart, if
she really took an interest in him, or was it only polite
pretense?</p>

<p>Ah, since Fate had made him love her against his
will, how glorious it would have been to win her—to
teach her the true beauty and sacredness of love, to
be proud of her, to realize with her the great happiness
of loving and being loved! It staggered him, the
trembling hope, the superlative joy of the thought.</p>

<p>Then came a quick revulsion:</p>

<p>“Her tender tones and looks mean nothing. She has
tried them on other men; she shall not tangle me in her
toils! It is all deceit, and I hate myself for being so
weak!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>He got up, fired with bitter anger at himself and
her, and made abrupt adieus to her and her aunt, saying
he had almost forgotten an appointment with Senator
Hoar in the delight of their society. He hoped
Viola would soon be well again and enjoying her re-entrance
into society, etc.; then he tore himself away.</p>

<p class="center">’TWIXT LOVE AND HATE.</p>


<p>When Desha was gone, Viola threw herself down
among her cushions, actually sobbing aloud in her
weakness.</p>

<p>Aunt Edwina exclaimed in alarm:</p>

<p>“There now, you have worked yourself into a nervous
spell, talking over your accident. So I must give
you some more of the drops the doctor left you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please do! I feel wretchedly ill and nervous!”
exclaimed the young girl; and when her aunt
had left the room, she cried out aloud:</p>

<p>“What a cold-hearted wretch! I thought he was
getting fond of me! And I—I—thought a great deal
of him—more than Florian would like, perhaps, if he
knew; but now I believe I hate the wretch more than
I ever did before!”</p>

<p>And the angry tears almost blistered her fair cheeks,
for the visitor’s seeming indifference had cut deep.</p>

<p>She was cruelly wounded, for she had cherished a
private conviction that he was yielding to her fascinations,
and the belief made her very happy, though
she had not acknowledged to her own heart yet that
she found him more attractive than any man she had
ever met, Florian not excepted.</p>

<p>How much pique and vanity had to do with her
emotion it is hard to say. If Desha had yielded weakly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
to her sway, she might have despised him. We ever
prize the unattainable. It is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The desire of the moth for the star,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the day for the morrow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her capricious heart, thus repulsed by Desha’s assumed
indifference, turned back awhile to Florian with
renewed tenderness, finding in his devotion a balm
for her wounded pride.</p>

<p>Feeling her enforced stay in the house until her
strength returned most irksome, she welcomed with
pleasure the frequent fond letters of her betrothed,
though they were very despondent in tone.</p>

<p>Florian wrote that his father’s condition was most
unsatisfactory. His partial paralysis did not yield to
treatment, and he remained in a dying condition, which
might terminate at any moment in his demise, or there
was a remote possibility of his lingering many weeks
in this unhappy state. Under the circumstances, Florian
being the only son, it was quite impossible for him
to leave Carlsbad. He must remain with his parents,
divided between love and duty, his heart distracted
with anxiety and grief.</p>

<p>“Ah, my darling, if you would but have come with
me, how much happier I should have been!” he wrote
most plaintively; adding: “Do you know that your
letter was most cruel? It was filled up with my friend
Desha and the handsome unknown who saved your
life. Ah, my love, do not let either of these men steal
you from me, for the loss of you would wreck my
life! I do not care to hear about them. It is news
of you, dearest, for which my lonely heart is hungry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
If you could see me looking at your beautiful photograph
and kissing it over and over, you would pity me
and write some sweet loving words to show that you
have not forgotten me in my enforced exile from
your side!”</p>

<p>Viola’s heart was touched by the pathos of the poor
fellow’s letter, and she brought out his photograph
and looked at it with tender eyes, saying, as she often
did:</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, how he loves me! He has a warm,
true heart!”</p>

<p>And she thought bitterly of that cold, indifferent
young statesman who had resisted all the allurements
of her beauty, and who was doubtless wedded to his
soaring ambitions.</p>

<p>In her bitterness at Desha, she wrote very tenderly
to Florian, filling his heart with delight, and quieting
his uneasiness by saying:</p>

<p>“You need not be jealous of Professor Desha; I
seldom see him any more. He devotes himself to congressional
affairs, and never goes into society now, so
I suppose he has forgotten my existence. As for the
young man who saved my life, he has never divulged
his identity, and does not intend to, I suppose, and I
should never give him another thought only that
gratitude demands it. Ah, Florian, how I miss you
these dull days while I must stay at home and get
strong! It is so lonely that I get more time to think
about my love for you. Yes, I do love you; you need
never doubt that! I look at your photograph often,
and kiss it, too, as you do mine! I think that whenever
you come back I will let you announce our engagement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and set the wedding-day. I wonder what
Professor Desha will think when he hears it.”</p>

<p>Florian was in the seventh heaven when he received
that letter.</p>

<p>It was the tenderest one she ever wrote him, for
very soon she went out again into society, and amid
her pleasures and her engagements had little time for
letters, so that he found her a most unpunctual correspondent,
though he entreated her to write frequently
to cheer his dull days passed by the bedside of his invalid
father and trying to comfort his grieving mother.</p>

<p>But whenever the brevity or the carelessness of
her later letters grieved him, he turned to the sweet,
tender one written under the impetus of her resentment
against Desha, and found solace in the words:</p>

<p>“Yes, I do love you—you need never doubt that.
I look at your photograph often, and kiss it, too, as
you do mine. I think that whenever you come back I
will let you announce our engagement and set the
wedding-day.”</p>

<p>Such promises were certainly enough to pin a lover’s
faith to, and Florian did not doubt her after that;
he only adored her more deeply, and longed for the
time of return, chafing in secret most bitterly against
the fate that kept him from her side.</p>

<p>So months passed away until the winter was over,
and in March Mr. Gay’s long illness ended in death,
and his son was free.</p>

<p>It was a blessed release from severe pain suffered
long, and the loving ones who had watched by him so
fondly were resigned to the affliction, because they
knew he had entered into rest at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>Arrangements were made to convey his body to his
native land for interment, and Florian’s heart leaped
with joy at the thought of seeing his love again, and
claiming the fulfillment of her sweet promises.</p>

<p>Of late Viola’s letters had been few and far between,
and marked by a growing coldness that sent a
chill to his warm heart, especially the last one, in
which she said:</p>

<p>“I shall have something very important to tell you
in my next letter.”</p>

<p>If Florian could have guessed what that important
something was, it would almost have broken his true,
loving heart; but before the next letter came he was
on the ocean, <i>en route</i> for home, whither we will precede
him in the gratification of our curiosity.</p>

<p class="center">HEART STRUGGLES.</p>


<p>Philip Desha had a will as firm as iron when he
made up his mind, and he carried out to the letter
his plan for avoiding beautiful Viola, and breaking
his heart loose from her chains.</p>

<p>Besides, his pride had been stimulated by a caution
Mrs. Wellford had given him the very day of the
skating-party, and shortly before the accident:</p>

<p>“Don’t carry out the simile of the moth, Cousin
Phil, and singe your wings in the candle’s flame.”</p>

<p>Her glance at Viola pointed the remark, and he
flushed warmly as he answered:</p>

<p>“Have no fear for me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wellford, who was a very charming young
woman, continued gravely:</p>

<p>“She is wonderfully fascinating, and I do not mind
confessing that I love her dearly. To me she appears
a thoughtless child, almost innocent of intentional
wrong-doing, but the fact remains that she has given
pain to many true, loving hearts by encouraging their
suits only to reject them at the last, after leading them
on with all the tactics of the most finished coquette.
I have even heard it said that she intends to have a
hundred rejections to boast of before she marries.”</p>

<p>“She will never add my name to the list,” he replied,
bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Do not be too sure. She can be irresistible when
she chooses, the little siren!” she exclaimed; and just
then some one joined them, and no more was said on
the subject.</p>

<p>But Philip Desha understood that his cousin’s pride
was enlisted lest Miss Van Lew should have the
triumph of adding him to the list of her victims.</p>

<p>“It shall never be,” he said to himself, passionately,
and held his course resolutely, keeping away from
every place where he was likely to meet the little
beauty.</p>

<p>“By and by I shall have conquered myself, then I
can meet her again with indifference,” he promised
himself.</p>

<p>But that by and by was slow in coming, he could not
deny that to himself.</p>

<p>He thought one reason was that he heard so much
about her, for the young men found her beauty a
favorite topic.</p>

<p>She scarcely ever missed a social function, and he
heard more than ever of her beauty and her coquetry.</p>

<p>“She is at her old trade of winning hearts. Apparently
she has forgotten her pretty penitence that day
for her petty vanities,” he thought, bitterly.</p>

<p>He never forgot the day when he made his first
speech of any length in Congress, and lifting his eyes
to the galleries, suddenly saw her sitting in the crowd
with her great luminous eyes fixed on his face, apparently
drinking in every word he uttered with as keen
an interest as if the political questions of the day were
her favorite topics.</p>

<p>It gave him a great start to see her there so unexpectedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and to meet the intent gaze that was so flattering
to his oratorical powers.</p>

<p>For a moment his voice broke with sheer surprise,
and he swept his hand across his face to hide the deep
flush that mantled it, only to be succeeded by deathly
pallor as he went on with his speech, but not so eloquently
as before, palpably unnerved by her presence
and her scrutiny—the bashfulness of a true man in
love.</p>

<p>For fight his passion as he might, Philip Desha had
not yet succeeded in ousting it out from his heart.</p>

<p>It was six weeks since he had seen her, but he
thrilled and trembled with emotion now as he bowed
to the speaker of the house, and resumed his seat
amid the applause of the galleries, but not daring to
look up again lest he meet the gaze of her speaking
eyes and be outdone by her fatally luring beauty.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he could feel her eyes burning
on his face, wonderingly, reproachfully, that he had
ignored her so long. Strong man as he was, he
trembled, feeling that he had to begin all over again
the struggle with his heart.</p>

<p>“There must be something uncanny about the girl.
She has bewitched me. I can not get free from her
Lorelei spell,” he told himself, with something like fear
of his enslaver, and suddenly rising, he hurried from
the hall as though to escape some evil influence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he was detained by some one in the
lobby several minutes, and presently getting out into
the corridor, started back in dismay, meeting Viola
and her aunt face to face.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">“A MAN’S HEART IS NOT SIMPLY A TOY!”</p>


<p>Before Viola went to the Capitol that morning she
had gone through something of a scene with her
father.</p>

<p>After breakfast he had asked her to come with him
to the library for a few moments.</p>

<p>Fondly slipping her little hand through his arm,
she had danced along by his side, exclaiming curiously:</p>

<p>“Papa, dear, what makes you look so grumpy this
morning?”</p>

<p>“You will soon know,” he replied, sternly, handing
her a chair.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew was a fine looking man about fifty
years old, whose life had been prematurely saddened
by the loss of two beautiful sons in their early childhood,
and afterward of his wife, when Viola was
eleven years old.</p>

<p>Mrs. Herman, his widowed sister, had very willingly
agreed to preside over his household when,
several years before, he had accepted a high position
in Washington and removed there from his native
state, West Virginia, where he had occupied a seat on
the judicial bench.</p>

<p>Viola had been educated at a high-class boarding-school
in Baltimore, and only a year ago had graduated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and made her <i>entrée</i> into Washington society.
Her grace and beauty and sprightliness had at once
made her a much-admired belle.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew was a quiet, undemonstrative man,
absorbed in politics since his wife’s death, and caring
little for social diversions; but he was both fond and
proud of Viola, and helped his sister Edwina to spoil
her to the top of her bent. His daughter knew only
the sunny side of his character, but the reverse of it
was stern and hard, a fact she was yet to learn to her
sorrow.</p>

<p>Leaving Viola to the social chaperonage of Mrs.
Herman, Judge Van Lew seldom accompanied her
himself to the brilliant functions that she graced with
her dazzling beauty, so it was a long time before a
shocking event opened his horrified eyes to the fact
that his beautiful young daughter was at once the most
admired belle and the most reckless flirt in the gay circles
where she moved—and this before she had attained
her nineteenth birthday. And it came upon him with
a shock of surprise.</p>

<p>Viola could not remember that her father had ever
given her a cold look or a harsh word, and she started
now at the sternness of his tone, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Papa, I hope you have no bad news for me! You
haven’t lost all your money by the failure of some
dreadful bank, have you, dear?”</p>

<p>How troubled she looked at the prospect, poor,
pretty Viola! and her likeness to her dead mother so
touched his heart, that he hastened to reassure her,
saying:</p>

<p>“You deserve some ill-fortune; but I have not lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
my money. I am not going to tell you that you can
have no more new gowns or jewels, or servants to
wait on you, or that you will have to move out of this
luxurious home into cheap lodgings.”</p>

<p>“Then what is it, dear papa? I am just wild with
curiosity,” she replied, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I am going to lecture you, Viola,” he returned,
with a sternness that struck terror to her heart.</p>

<p>“Dear me, what have I done, papa?” she exclaimed,
in such innocent wonder that he found it hard to go
on, she had such an appealing air of injured innocence.</p>

<p>Gathering his courage for the final attack, and steeling
his heart against her appealing eyes, he returned,
sadly and gravely:</p>

<p>“Viola, I had a great shock last night, and I could
scarcely sleep afterward, I was so terribly unnerved.
Can you guess what I mean?”</p>

<p>“No, papa,” she replied truthfully.</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you, Viola, that I learned last
night a dreadful truth about my dear little daughter
whom I believed to be so good and pretty and tender-hearted.
I learned that she is a heartless girl guilty
of sin in the sight of God, although there is no earthly
law to punish her for her folly.”</p>

<p>“Papa!” she gasped in horror, going deathly white
with indignation, two pearly tears flashing into her
great luminous gray eyes, almost black now with excitement.
“Papa, who has slandered me to you? Who
dares accuse me of anything wrong?”</p>

<p>She almost fainted when he answered, sternly and
rebukingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“You thoughtless child, it is only the mercy of God
that has saved a lost soul from being your accuser
this moment at the bar of Heaven!”</p>

<p>Viola’s wonder and amazement only increased at
this terrible charge from her father’s lips. She felt
herself sinking, almost fainting, as he caught her
hand, looking anxiously into her face.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she recovered herself, and sighed
fearfully:</p>

<p>“I do not understand, papa.”</p>

<p>“You have heard nothing?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Nothing, papa,” wildly.</p>

<p>“Then prepare yourself for a great shock, Viola,
for surely you can not be as heartless as the world
believes you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, papa!” she cried, eagerly, wondering if he
had found out her secret engagement to Florian, and
was going to scold her for it.</p>

<p>It was something like that, she discovered the next
moment, for he added:</p>

<p>“You were at Mrs. Dean’s reception last night, and
a young government clerk, George Merrington, proposed
to you.”</p>

<p>Viola’s eyes dilated with wonder, but she answered,
eagerly:</p>

<p>“Yes, papa, but—I refused him.”</p>

<p>To her amazement, he asked, angrily:</p>

<p>“What right had you, Viola, to refuse him?”</p>

<p>“Why, papa, what a question! I had a right because
I did not love him!” cried Viola, gaining courage
again.</p>

<p>“You did not love him, you say, Viola; then why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
did you lead him to believe that you did? Why did
you flirt with the poor young fellow till he felt sure
of you, and ventured to lay his honest heart at your
feet?” angrily.</p>

<p>“Papa, no man has a right to be sure of a woman’s
heart until he has asked for it and been answered,”
she replied, uneasily, seeing that he was in deadly
earnest.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” he answered, earnestly. “A
true man and woman, when truly in love, may always
be sure of each other. The woman may always show
her preference without brushing the bloom from her
modesty. All honor to her for doing so, and everlasting
shame for pretending what she does not feel
for the poor triumph of rejecting him at the last.”</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew’s scathing words sank into his
daughter’s soul, and she hid her burning face in her
hands, trying to stem the torrent of his reproaches
by faltering:</p>

<p>“Really, papa, I meant no harm. I was simply
kind to him. I could not tell him to go away because
I saw he was learning to love me, could I? And, besides,”
hopefully, “you—you would have been furious
if I had accepted him, you know you would. He is
only a government clerk, you know, and I—have refused
a senator, a general, some millionaires—and
others,” proudly.</p>

<p>He knew that what she said was true. He would
not have accepted George Merrington for a son-in-law.
He was proud, but withal he was just, and justice
ranged him on the side of the discarded suitor.</p>

<p>He answered reproachfully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Subterfuge will not help you, Viola; for a good
woman can always find a way to dismiss a man before
the affair reaches the point of a proposal, unless the
man is a fool and can not read her face; and George
Merrington was no fool, though he acted like a madman
afterward. You simply coquetted with him, led
him on by encouraging smiles and words, just for the
amusement of the moment. Is this not true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa; but I meant no harm. I did not regard
it as a serious matter at all. Plenty of girls do the
same,” said Viola, frankly, trying to smile him into
a good humor.</p>

<p>But he remained portentously grave, as he returned:</p>

<p>“I believe you have erred through thoughtless vanity,
my daughter, and that you do not realize the
sacredness of love. That is the only excuse I can find
for what you have done. But from today I wish you
to turn over a new leaf, and give up this despicable
flirting that has so nearly ended in a terrible tragedy
that must have lain heavily on your conscience forever.
You must promise me today that you will never
again lead any man on, to gratify your love of conquest
at the expense of his happiness.”</p>

<p>His words and looks were so solemn that she exclaimed,
almost petulantly:</p>

<p>“Papa, you talk of a tragedy. Do you call a harmless
flirtation with George Merrington a tragedy?”</p>

<p>“A harmless flirtation, Viola! Wait till you hear
all,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well, papa, I am waiting to hear all that you will
tell me. Did George Merrington come to you to complain
of my flirting with him?” sarcastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>To her amazement and indignation, he replied instantly:</p>

<p>“Yes; he came from the reception where you had
refused the offer of his warm, loving heart, with a
girlish laugh and jest, straight to the club where I
was sitting with some gentlemen, and he told me the
truth about you—that you were the most heartless
coquette in the world, and had broken his heart just
as you had broken many others. Then crying, ‘Bid
her remember she wrecked my life!’ he whipped out
a pistol, and before any one could prevent the rash
deed, fired a bullet into his breast!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Heaven!” shrieked Viola, remorsefully, and
sank back like one dying.</p>

<p>He bent over her in an agony of pitying love, soothing
her back to calmness, saying, gently:</p>

<p>“I knew it would shock you terribly, Viola, but it
had to be told. Indeed, I feared you had heard it
already. It must be a lesson to you hereafter never
to amuse yourself at flirting again. A man’s heart is
not simply a toy.”</p>

<p>“Dead! dead! and through my folly! Oh, what a
bitter thought!” sobbed the poor girl, remorsefully.</p>

<p>But her father answered:</p>

<p>“No; thank Heaven, the wound was not a mortal
one. The bullet was meant for his heart, but it was
deflected from its course by a silver card-case in his
breast-pocket, and imbedded itself in a less vital point.
He was removed to Garfield Hospital, and will very
likely recover.”</p>

<p>“But every one will be talking about it and blaming
me. I can never hold up my head again!” moaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Viola, and strangely enough, the keenest inward pang
was the instant thought: “What will Professor Desha
say about it?”</p>

<p>To her joy and relief, her father answered, kindly:</p>

<p>“I have taken care of that, Viola, for your sake.
There were but three men with me when young Merrington
burst in upon us, and I have persuaded them
to keep the truth a secret. The poor fellow himself
is glad now, that he did not die, and glad that I invented
a clever story to account for his accident. We
told his mother, who was frantic with grief, that he
was showing us a pistol supposed not to be loaded—common
occurrence, you know—and it went off and
wounded him. He will get well, I think; and as for
you, dear, you must, as I said just now, turn over a
new leaf.”</p>

<p>Viola clung to his neck, sobbing remorsefully:</p>

<p>“Oh, I will—I will, papa, if you will forgive me
for the past! I hate flirting now, and will never be so
thoughtless any more!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THEIR MEETING.</p>


<p>Viola sought her own apartments in a whirlwind
of contending emotions, and threw herself upon a
couch to sob and moan in passionate excitement.</p>

<p>Her father’s words and poor Merrington’s fate made
her realize for the first time something of the enormity
of what she had done.</p>

<p>She saw that her father was ashamed of her, and
the pang cut deep, for she was proud of his love and
his good opinion.</p>

<p>She remembered that Professor Desha had also expressed
himself strongly against her flirtations.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was why he had withdrawn himself
from her society, despising her for the same things
that her father had so bitterly condemned.</p>

<p>Both of them she knew were high-minded men, and
had a right to have their opinions respected.</p>

<p>Now that her folly and thoughtlessness had been
shown her so plainly, Viola began to feel ashamed
and remorseful over what had heretofore been her
pride and delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry, so sorry!” she cried, remorsefully.
“Indeed I did not realize that I was causing
real pain to any one. But now I will never flirt again!”</p>

<p>While she was bathing her pink eyelids with <i>eau-de-Cologne</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
to remove the tell-tale trace of tears, Aunt
Edwina came gliding in, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, what is the matter? You have been
crying!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I have taken a bad cold, that is all,”
returned the young girl, unwilling for her aunt to
learn what had happened.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that, Viola, for I hoped you would
feel like going with me to the Capitol this morning.
I heard that there would be speaking in the House of
Representatives today on the Cuban war, and I should
like to hear it.”</p>

<p>Viola knew that she should spend a wretched day
moping at home alone, so she answered quickly:</p>

<p>“I will go with you, auntie, for I would like to hear
the speeches, too. I dare say it will not make my cold
any worse.”</p>

<p>“Not if you wrap up warmly, dear, and wear a veil;
so I will go and get ready,” returned the kind, unsuspecting
old lady, hurrying out again.</p>

<p>Viola dabbled her face with the fragrant waters till
all the signs of tears were gone; but she could not
smile away the brooding sadness that lay beneath the
dark fringe of her lashes—the sadness of trouble and
remorse.</p>

<p>She dressed herself carefully in her warmest attire,
for the midwinter days were very keen, and she and
her aunt set forth for the Capitol, a little gleam of
interest flashing into her eyes as she remembered that
she was likely to see Philip Desha there.</p>

<p>It was six weeks since she had seen the young congressman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
He seemed to have faded from her life,
though not from her thoughts.</p>

<p>If Desha had wished to keep himself vividly in
Viola’s memory he could not have adopted a better plan
than this absence and reserve.</p>

<p>The angry pique that had caused her first interest in
him only increased with time, and the smart of his
coldness made her wish more ardently to win him, so
strange are the contradictions of the human heart.</p>

<p>But pride forbade her seeking him, so she had let
him pass passively from her life until today, when in
her aunt’s company she sought the Capitol, knowing
that she was almost certain to see him there, and feeling
her heart leap wildly at the thought, while she said
to herself:</p>

<p>“Oh, how clever it was in papa to get that dreadful
case of George Merrington so nicely covered up, and
how thankful I am that people will never know the
real truth about it. I would not like for Professor
Desha to find it out. How he would despise me!”</p>

<p>So it happened that as the young congressman was
nearing the close of his brilliant speech that day, some
magnetic influence made him raise his blue eyes to the
crowded gallery and meet the rapt, intense gaze of
Viola’s splendid, luminous gray orbs fixed on him with
an eager interest that almost robbed him of the last
iota of self-possession.</p>

<p>She saw him start and almost falter at the recognition,
and wondered why it could move him so.</p>

<p>When he left the hall awhile later she lost all interest
in the animated scene, and persuaded her aunt
to leave also; but it was a great surprise to her as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
as to him when they came together, face to face, in the
corridor, owing to the delay caused by his spending a
few moments talking in the lobby.</p>

<p>They were about to pass each other with slight, cold
bows, in spite of the fierce throbbing of either heart,
when fate, in the person of Mrs. Herman, intervened.</p>

<p>The old lady who had all the graceful cordiality of
the Virginia gentlewoman, started forward eagerly,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“How do you do, my dear professor? I am so glad
to have this opportunity to congratulate you on your
eloquent speech which I enjoyed so much.”</p>

<p>He had to stop, perforce, for a short chat with them,
and then he observed in Viola a subtle, indefinable
change, a gentle reserve, a dignified coldness, that
somehow aroused in him a distinct pique.</p>

<p>“She resents my pointed neglect. Perhaps, after all,
I carried it too far,” he thought, with some embarrassment,
almost wishing for her old cordial vivacity.</p>

<p>“I have not seen you in an age. Have you abjured
society?” continued Mrs. Herman.</p>

<p>“Almost,” he replied; adding: “We congressmen
are here to work for our country’s good, not to enjoy
ourselves, you know, dear madame.”</p>

<p>She insisted that he should look in for an hour, at
least, at her next reception, and it would have been
churlish to refuse. He promised to come if he could
spare the time, handed them to their carriage, and
bowed himself away.</p>

<p>And he could think of nothing else all day but Viola.</p>

<p>How graceful she had appeared in her pose of unbending
dignity, with that slight air of <i>ennui</i>, or <i>hauteur</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
he could scarcely tell which! How rich was the
bloom of her dimpled cheek against the high collar of
her seal-skin wrap, how dark and serious her eyes had
appeared through her thin veil, how exquisite the crimson
of her full lips! Every separate charm recurred to
him over and over, carrying his heart again by storm.</p>

<p>And with a grim smile, he said to himself:</p>

<p>“I think I understand her change from girlish vivacity
to that quiet, graceful, natural dignity. She has
given over the attempt to coquet with me, to break my
heart, as she once threatened. She has found out that
she cannot move me, and given over the effort. I shall
be quite safe to attend her reception, since she has
grown so cold and indifferent.”</p>

<p class="center">TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.</p>


<p>So when the evening of the Van Lew reception arrived,
the young congressman ventured to go, deeming
unwisely that security for himself lay in Viola’s indifference.</p>

<p>He was a very clever politician, but a mere tyro in
matters of the heart.</p>

<p>Viola and her aunt were receiving, assisted by a bevy
of handsome matrons and fair young girls. When she
saw Desha bowing before her, she gave him a courteous
welcome, just tinged with the delicate frostiness under
which he had shivered that day at the Capitol.</p>

<p>It was superb acting, for her heart leaped wildly at
the conventional touch of his hand.</p>

<p>But she said proudly to herself:</p>

<p>“He shall not know I am glad he came.”</p>

<p>And she looked quickly away from him, without observing
that he stood still a minute, half dazed by her
marvelous beauty, so richly set off by the silvery white
gown and the fire of rubies on her neck and in her hair.</p>

<p>Turning away presently, he sighed, with a paling
cheek:</p>

<p>“After all, it was not wise to come. I shall be dreaming
of her all night. Heavens! how peerless she is!
And, alas! how heartless!”</p>

<p>All at once he began to be afraid of himself, afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to go near her, lest he should fall down at her feet and
declare his passion, so intoxicated had he suddenly become
with the charm of her presence. He was almost
tempted to run away.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘But most of all would I flee from the cruel madness of love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The honey of poison-flowers and all the measureless ill.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Viola had no suspicion of what was passing in his
mind. She was careful to avoid him, in her humility
over her father’s lecture.</p>

<p>She remembered with shame how she had once tried
to attract him, and how he had proved his indifference
to her arts by remaining away. Very well; she
would show him that she was changed, that she too,
was indifferent now.</p>

<p>The guests found a new dignity in her manner, a
subtle change not easily defined. There was no lingering
in alcoves with some spell-bound adorer, no
arch glances, sudden, swift, and strange, bewildering
masculine hearts.</p>

<p>Sweetly cordial to all, she yet kept strictly to her
resolve to “turn over a new leaf.”</p>

<p>He came upon his cousin, Mrs. Wellford, presently,
and the handsome young matron said, curiously:</p>

<p>“What has come over Viola tonight? Every one is
saying there is something almost sad about her manner.
Do you think she can really be grieving about
young Merrington, as some are hinting?”</p>

<p>“Young Merrington! I know nothing of him,” he
replied, with a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“True; you have been out of the swim for more
than a month, Phil. Indeed, I was surprised to see
you here tonight. Well, as I was saying, this young
Merrington—a handsome boy of twenty-two, a government
clerk, the <i>protégé</i> of Senator Costigan—was
Viola’s latest flirtation.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“I never saw any one so madly, foolishly in love in
my life,” said the matron. “It was tiresome to see
him mooning about after the wicked little flirt. Every
one was wishing he would propose and get his <i>congé</i>,
so that we might get some new affair on the <i>tapis</i> to
amuse us, when quite suddenly it ended almost tragically.
He was fooling with a pistol the other night—unloaded,
of course,” satirically, “and he put a bullet
in his breast.”</p>

<p>“Not dead?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet; but at Garfield Hospital in a precarious
condition. And they say Viola is secretly taking
it hard. She can not bear to hear it alluded to at all,
growing pale and nervous, and almost weeping. And
she is certainly changed—no more flirting, no more
gayety save of the most dignified kind. How strange
if she had really lost her heart to him after all!”</p>

<p>His face paled and his heart beat violently with a
keen, stinging pain. Was it jealousy of young Merrington
who had wrought in her that subtle change
he had wondered over?</p>

<p>He said, slowly:</p>

<p>“What if it be remorse, not love? What if he had
already received his <i>congé</i>? What if the accident—was
not an accident?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Wellford shuddered.</p>

<p>“What a terrible suggestion! Fortunately for
Viola’s peace of mind, it is not true. My husband
was one of the men who witnessed the accident. It
shocked him so much, he does not like to go over the
details even to me,” replied Mrs. Wellford, innocently.</p>

<p>Desha looked with new interest at Viola as some one
led her to the piano.</p>

<p>So she <i>could</i> love, the beautiful coquette, and she
had learned the lesson at last! This, then, was the
secret of the change in her, the pensive shade that
touched her face. Love and sorrow had come to her
hand in hand.</p>

<p>He felt a great curiosity over the young man who
had touched Viola’s heart, when the proudest and the
richest had sued to her in vain.</p>

<p>“Yet most probably he is not worthy of the prize,”
he thought, vehemently. “Some handsome, flippant
youth, such as most often takes the fancy of very
young girls.”</p>

<p>But it gave him a pang to think that his own years
numbered thirty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Quite an old man in her eyes, very likely,” he
thought, ruefully, as he moved a little nearer the piano
to watch her face while she sang.</p>

<p>Her singing was one of the many rare gifts the
good fairies had brought to Viola’s cradle at her birth.
Her voice was a rare soprano, full of passion and
feeling, and it thrilled every heart as she sang:</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">As the deep, dark sea.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song fixed itself in Desha’s memory, and the
day came when he recalled it in wonder.</p>

<p>She would not sing again, but she played them
some rare instrumental pieces—two very gay and brilliant,
one exquisitely sad and sweet; and this last one
stayed in Desha’s heart with the song, because of their
melting pathos, so different from anything formerly
associated with the lovely, volatile belle. He had not
believed that her feelings were deep enough for the
pathos to which she had given expression through
her voice and touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“Love has taught her everything,” he thought, with
unconscious, bitter envy of George Merrington.</p>

<p>“I must be going presently, because I shall look in
at another reception tonight,” Mrs. Wellford said,
arousing him from something like a trance of thought.
“I wish you would find my husband for me, Phil. He
has stolen off to some quiet corner to smoke, I expect.
Tell him I am going in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, absently, moving away from
her side, and wondering why Viola had so suddenly
left the room just as he was thinking of bidding her
good-night.</p>

<p>He wandered about through the crowded rooms,
wondering where he should find Mr. Wellford, who
was a successful patent attorney devoted to his business,
and secretly bored by gay society, though his
wife dragged him into it willy-nilly. Having made
his bow to his hostess, he was usually to be found in
some secluded spot, seeking solace in a good cigar,
and all the happier if he could find some congenial
soul to share his pleasure and exchange good stories
with him.</p>

<p>He was not in the thronged drawing-room, nor library,
nor supper-room, so Desha went along the wide
hall, seeking all the open doors, thinking perchance to
blunder on a smoking-room.</p>

<p>The scent of a Havana came to him suddenly,
promising speedy success, so he stopped abruptly before
the half-drawn <i>portière</i> of a small room or alcove,
with tall palms and flowering azaleas standing about
in a dim, soft light. They had, in fact, been removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
here temporarily from the over-crowded conservatory,
to make room for the promenading couples tonight.</p>

<p>“He is here, the vandal, with his cigar,” thought
Desha, pushing back the curtain and blundering across
the threshold.</p>

<p>Some one was there certainly, but not Wellford, and
the young man started back, hoping his intrusion might
not be observed.</p>

<p>Viola, laboring under strong excitement of mind,
exaggerated by his neglect and the keen pathos of her
own music, had hidden herself away here for a brief,
hysterical outbreak that she could not control.</p>

</div>

<p>When Desha saw the white-robed girl hidden
there among the palms, with her face in her hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
sobbing low and bitterly, a passionate longing came to
him to take her in his arms and try to comfort her in
her tender sorrow, but instead he turned quickly away,
praying in his heart that she would not notice his
intrusion.</p>

<p>But through her stifled sobs Viola’s ear caught the
sound of the entering footstep. She sprang forward
to hide herself behind the palm from curious eyes, and
at the same moment caught the sound of a heavy fall.</p>

<p>Peering from behind her ambush, she saw that the
intruder, in his haste to retreat, had stumbled over
a flower-stand and fallen just inside the door. He
must have been stunned by the fall, for he lay quite
motionless, with his pale, handsome face upturned to
the light, and she saw with alarm that it was no other
than the object of her painful thoughts—Philip Desha!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A SWEET CONFESSION.</p>


<p>Viola darted forward with a stifled cry, and knelt
by the silent, recumbent figure.</p>

<p>She saw that a few drops of blood had started
from a small cut on his white temple, and guessed that
in falling he had struck his head against the corner of
the flower-stand, thus rendering him momentarily unconscious.</p>

<p>All the womanly tenderness in her started with
grief at the sight, and dipping her lace handkerchief,
already wet with tears, into a glass globe that held
some beautiful gold fish, she began to bathe his face
with the cold water, murmuring agitatedly to herself:</p>

<p>“I must try to revive him myself, for I should not
like to call for help. The situation would be rather
embarrassing. They would only say I was here flirting
with him, and wonder why he fell down, and at
the tears on my cheeks.”</p>

<p>And she dabbled his face and fair hair most energetically
with the cold water, her soft hands touching
him caressingly, freighted with the love that filled her
heart.</p>

<p>And her fair face bent so close to his in her anxiety
that the salty drops of pity fell on his brow and
mixed with the cold water she was so copiously using
as a restorative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Then she began to get frightened.</p>

<p>“Why, how long he is in reviving! It must be more
serious than I thought!” she cried, anxiously; adding:
“I am afraid I must call help; but I will wait a minute
longer.”</p>

<p>It was enough to frighten her, that deathly stillness
and pallor of the handsome man, and she sobbed:</p>

<p>“Oh, what if this should be death? I have heard
that a blow on the temple might cause death. And
here is quite a keen little cut. I—I wish that I could
kiss it and make it well, as mothers say to their little
children.”</p>

<p>She mopped his face again with the water, she
chafed his cold hands again in hers with a tenderness
that was enough to call a dead man back to life, but
still he lay there mute and pale, arousing her worst
fears.</p>

<p>She began to pray in a low, whispering voice full
of pathos:</p>

<p>“Oh, God, do not be so cruel as to let him die!
Give him back to me! He is the only man in the
world that I could love! Perhaps that is why you will
let him die—to punish me for my wicked flirtations
when I did not know what a pain love was—real love
that aches in my heart for him, though he despises me.
And no wonder, for he is a thousand times too good
for me, and could never love me because I have been
so vain and silly, for of course he could not know how
I have repented now. Oh, God, spare him, don’t let
him die—don’t let him die!”</p>

<p>It was enough to move angels to pity, the low, whispering
voice, the tears, the clasped hands; but Heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
seemed deaf to her prayer, for the lids still lay heavily
on Desha’s eyes, and she could not see his broad chest
move with the faintest breath.</p>

<p>Her heart sank with a terrible alarm, and she murmured,
wildly:</p>

<p>“I must summon help!”</p>

<p>But just as she was rising from her knees, she saw
his eyelids move, then flutter languidly open.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she murmured, in a tremor of joy and thanksgiving,
and his large blue eyes gazed languidly into
her own.</p>

<p>“Viola!” he murmured, in a soft voice freighted
with ecstasy, and she started at the sound of her name
from his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are better!” she exclaimed, gladly, her
voice trembling with the joy of her heart. “May I
help you to rise?” holding out her little hands.</p>

<p>He accepted the proffered aid most eagerly, and
when he had risen to his feet, retained the little hands,
and drew her suddenly to his heart.</p>

<p>“Viola, don’t shrink away from me!” he cried, ardently.
“I love you, darling—have loved you hopelessly
for months, but just now as I was coming back
to consciousness, I thought I was in Heaven, for I
heard low, whispered words from your dear lips—a
prayer for my life, a confession that I was dear to you.
Oh, Viola, is it indeed true? Am I so blest as to hold
a place in your heart? Will you be kind to me? Will
you be my wife?”</p>

<p>“I love you, Philip!” sobbed the agitated girl, hiding
her face on his breast, and trembling at the ardent kiss
he pressed on her quivering, crimson lips.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>“I will be your wife, dear Philip, but no one must
know of our engagement just yet. You must keep it a
secret until I give you leave to tell.”</p>

<p>Viola whispered those words against her lover’s
cheek before they returned to the drawing-room, and
they gave him a keen pang of disappointment.</p>

<p>He was so madly in love and so proud of having
captured Viola’s illusive heart that he would have liked
to publish his engagement at once to the whole astonished
world.</p>

<p>Viola, now that she had foresworn flirting, would
not have objected to his doing so, but in the midst of
her keen happiness at having won her lover, a blasting
memory had coldly shaken her heart—the thought of
her engagement to Florian Gay.</p>

<p>She almost fainted with fear when she remembered
that she was not free to accept Philip Desha, since
her hand was promised to another.</p>

<p>She thought quickly:</p>

<p>“I will write to Florian and take back my promise,
but Philip must never, never know the truth about it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
for he has such high ideals, and might blame me for
appearing so fickle.”</p>

<p>Her mind ran rapidly over the obstacles in her way,
and she decided that her new engagement must not be
announced till her old one was broken off—in other
words, it was best to be off with the old love before
she was on with the new.</p>

<p>So she bound her betrothed by the promise to keep
their engagement secret, though he chafed against it,
saying:</p>

<p>“I shall not like for people to be saying you are flirting
with me as you did with others, my darling.”</p>

<p>The words had a sting for Viola’s heart, and tears
flashed into her eyes.</p>

<p>She cried, hastily:</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall never flirt again, never! I am quite
cured of that since—” She paused, bit her rosy lip,
and added: “I understand how you feel. I—I will
not make you keep the secret long—only until—” She
paused again in dismay, finding she had almost uttered
aloud her thought that she would only keep him silent
until Florian granted her her freedom.</p>

<p>“Until—when?” asked Desha, gravely, with his
large, frank blue eyes on her face.</p>

<p>Viola blushed, and answered, evasively:</p>

<p>“Oh, until two or three weeks,” adding to herself
that she would write to Florian tomorrow, and tell him
she could not marry him, because she had learned to
love his friend, Professor Desha, better, and that she
must take back her promise. Of course he would write
back and say that under the circumstances he released
her and wished her much happiness. Then she would
be free to have her engagement announced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>But even in the midst of her little scheming came a
remorseful thought.</p>

<p>“Poor Florian! It will make him very sad. He
loved me dearly.”</p>

<p>And the next day she could not bring herself to
write the words that should strike down his happy
dream of love.</p>

<p>Keen remorse seized on her heart for having been so
fickle in her love that the fancy had not outlived
Florian’s absence.</p>

<p>“It seems so cruel to sadden his heart just now when
he is in trouble over his sick father. I will wait till
tomorrow,” she decided.</p>

<p>When tomorrow came she found herself too cowardly
still to give Florian pain. She kept putting off
her duty from day to day, and almost forgetting Florian
as she basked in the smiles of her new lover.</p>

<p>But when three weeks had passed, and society was
loudly whispering that Congressman Desha was Miss
Van Lew’s latest victim, succeeding George Merrington
in her good graces, the lover began to chafe under
the gossip, and reminded his idol that she had promised
to end his probation in three weeks.</p>

<p>Viola turned pale and pleaded for more time. She
saw a shadow cross his face, and he asked, abruptly:</p>

<p>“Viola, can I trust you? Do you really love me, or
are you simply trifling with my honest, manly love?”</p>

<p>The sternness of his voice frightened Viola, who
was always in terror lest he might find out the truth
about Florian or George Merrington, and hate her for
her coquetry.</p>

<p>She faltered:</p>

<p>“I will give you such a proof of my love that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
can not doubt me any longer. If you will keep the
secret of our engagement until I give you leave to
speak, you may ask papa for me at any time you wish
and name the wedding-day.”</p>

<p>He caught her little velvety soft hands and covered
them with ardent kisses.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest one, my beautiful love, how I thank
you for these sweet concessions!” he cried, rapturously,
and added, happily: “I shall speak to your
father tomorrow, and with your permission I shall
name an early date for the wedding. I am too impatient
to wait long for my happiness!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she answered, meekly and willingly,
for with every day her reluctance to write the truth to
Florian grew greater. Part of it was pity for the pain
she must inflict on the true heart that loved her so,
and part of it was something like fear.</p>

<p>She had remembered with alarm her playful threats,
that during his absence she might find some one she
loved better than himself, and his quick exclamation:</p>

<p>“Woe be unto him!”</p>

<p>She who had been so gay and careless before, had
become a changed girl since the affair of George Merrington.
And when she remembered Florian’s devotion,
and the cruel wound she was going to give his
heart, she recalled with dismay her father’s words:</p>

<p>“A man’s heart is not simply a toy!”</p>

<p>Viola had always thought so till then, and now she
was afraid of the consequences of her coquetry.</p>

<p>It dawned on her that Florian might possibly be
very angry at her fickleness, perhaps seek revenge.</p>

<p>What if he should hasten home and denounce her,
like George Merrington, for her fault? What if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
should betray her to Professor Desha? She trembled
at the very thought.</p>

<p>“I should lose him forever! He would sacrifice me
to his high ideal of honor! And I can not give him
up, he was too hard to win!” she sighed, recalling all
her pangs at Desha’s coldness.</p>

<p>She became afraid to write the truth to Florian, but
she replied to his fond love letters in the briefest,
coldest fashion, hoping he would understand that her
love was dead, and himself hasten in anger to release
her from her promise.</p>

<p>So matters stood when Desha reminded her of her
promise to let him announce their engagement, his
manly pride chafing against the society chatter about
their flirtation.</p>

<p>Viola’s sweet promises set all his fears at rest, and
he hastened to avail himself of her permission to speak
to her father.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew gave a surprised and secretly reluctant
consent.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant thought for the ambitious
father that his charming daughter, who had refused
millionaires and men of the highest rank, should descend
to a simple congressman who had not won his
laurels yet, and was only moderately rich.</p>

<p>But he knew that Desha was well-born, high-minded,
and intelligent. If Viola loved him and wanted him,
there was really no valid objection he could raise, so
he gave his cold approval.</p>

<p>Then the eager lover startled Viola very much by
asking her if she would set the wedding for March.</p>

<p>“But it is the last of January now. I should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
but one month to get ready,” she cried, blushingly;
but, with a little urging, she consented.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were mutually afraid of losing each
other, Desha dreading her coquetry, she afraid he
might find out the secrets she was hiding from him.</p>

<p>When she had given her consent, he said, seriously:</p>

<p>“We ought to take the public into our confidence
now.”</p>

<p>“They do not deserve it; they have gossiped about
me too much already,” Viola pouted, prettily.</p>

<p>He remained silent, thinking her very unreasonable,
and then she smiled at his gravity, saying, coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Well, then, I want to give them a grand sensation.
What do you say to keeping our secret until we send
out our wedding-cards? Will not that give everybody
a great surprise?” laughingly.</p>

<p>“I should think so,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let us have it so. I have given up to
you in everything else. Let me have my own way in
this,” pleaded Viola so sweetly that he could not refuse,
though he was eager to have the truth known so
that people would stop referring to him as Miss Van
Lew’s latest distinguished conquest.</p>

<p>Most especially would he have liked to tell the real
truth to his cousin, Mrs. Wellford, who badgered him
not a little about his attentions to Viola.</p>

<p>Her cousinly pride was up in arms for his sake, hating
for his true heart to be played with and cast aside
like others that she knew.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly abominable!” she complained to her
husband. “I thought Philip had more sense than to
run after such a wicked little coquette.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were fond of Viola,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“So I am—at least I used to be, till she began to
entangle my cousin in her toils. But now I almost
hate her, for Phil is too good and true to break his
heart for her sake. She has bewitched him so that he
has lost the use of his brains!” she replied, petulantly.</p>

<p>“I do not see how you can help it,” he replied,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That is what makes me so angry. I have warned
him, and he treats my warnings with contempt. Oh,
if I had my way I should like to make him draw back,
even now, and foil her in her little game of adding his
name to the list of one hundred rejections she is so
busily making!” she exclaimed, excitedly.</p>

<p>Her husband looked at her thoughtfully, replying:</p>

<p>“Ruby, I wonder if you could keep a secret.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, John. Only try me and see,” she
replied, eagerly.</p>

<p>Hesitating a moment, he continued:</p>

<p>“Since you are so anxious over Desha, there is something
you could tell him that would no doubt disgust
him with the lovely coquette, if anything in the world
could do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it? Tell me quickly, John!”</p>

<p>“I will tell you; but remember, Ruby, dear, that it
must never go out of the keeping of yourself and
Desha!” earnestly.</p>

<p class="center">QUEEN OF SONG AND LOVE AND BEAUTY.</p>


<p>Viola’s wedding-cards came out just ten days before
the time appointed for the ceremony, creating an immense
sensation, just as she had prophesied.</p>

<p>Society was so surprised that it talked of nothing
else for three whole days.</p>

<p>On the same day she received one of Florian’s fond
letters, begging her to write oftener and more kindly.</p>

<p>She replied at once, saying that she had been too
busy to write, and knew that he would excuse her
when he received her next letter, in which she would
have something important to tell him.</p>

<p>In her dread lest Florian’s resentment of her treachery
should lead him to betray her to Desha, she had
finally resolved not to write to her jilted lover until
the day after the wedding.</p>

<p>“Philip will be my own then—no one can take him
from me,” she thought, feverishly; for now and then
a faint foreboding of evil made her heart quake with
fear lest she should lose him yet by some untoward
stroke of fate.</p>

<p>It lacked but ten days to the wedding now, and
lively preparations were going forward for a grand
church ceremony, and afterward for a magnificent
home reception before the happy pair started on their
Southern tour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>A splendid <i>trousseau</i> was being prepared in New
York, and arrived each day in detachments, taking
up so much time in trying on that Viola scarcely had
time to spare for her lover.</p>

<p>At breakfast that morning Judge Van Lew said to
his daughter and sister:</p>

<p>“I have employed a young man to prepare some
statistics for me from some valuable books in my library.
He will come at about ten o’clock, and you
will please see that he has uninterrupted use of the
library, as it will take several days to do the task, and
I am in a hurry for these statistics.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Mrs. Herman; adding carelessly:
“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“He is Rolfe Maxwell—a very interesting young
man. Came to Washington recently to try to secure a
pension for his mother, whom he is supporting by
journalistic work. Unfortunately, he lost his position
on a good New York daily, by a long spell of illness,
and must now do anything that comes to hand until he
can get more reporting to do. He was well recommended
to me by a senator for whom he had done
some work, and I was very glad to get him to do this
job for me. You need not think he will be at all in
the way, Edwina, as he will take his meals at home
each day.”</p>

<p>He rose, kissed Viola good-bye as usual, and hurried
away to his department, while she said regretfully to
her aunt:</p>

<p>“I am sorry he is coming. Philip always likes to be
entertained in the library.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there’s plenty of room elsewhere. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
would not be well to hinder your father’s business for
a mere whim; besides, the poor young man may stand
in need of the money,” replied the kind old lady.</p>

<p>Viola agreed with her and dismissed the subject
from her mind; but not so Aunt Edwina, whom a mild
curiosity induced to receive Rolfe Maxwell when he
made his appearance promptly at ten o’clock.</p>

<p>She remained a few minutes conversing with him,
then returned to the dainty morning-room, where she
usually sat with Viola.</p>

<p>The beautiful girl glanced up with languid interest,
asking:</p>

<p>“Did you like him, auntie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a very nice young man,” carelessly.</p>

<p>“Handsome?”</p>

<p>“That is always your first thought about a man,
Viola. Handsome is as handsome does, you know,”
returned Mrs. Herman, cautiously. She did not know
that her niece had foresworn flirting, and she dreaded
her propensities in that line too much to confess to her
that Rolfe Maxwell, though slight and pale from recent
devastating illness, was one of the most elegant-looking
men she had ever beheld—tall and stately,
with magnificent Oriental dark eyes and hair, and with
a soldierly bearing full of quiet, impressive dignity.</p>

<p>In order to allay Viola’s interest, she added, sympathetically:</p>

<p>“I hope your papa will pay him well for his work,
for he looks like he needed it, poor fellow. He is
almost shabby, although perfectly neat, and so pale
and thin, as if he hardly had enough to eat, although
I remember now that your papa said he had been ill,
which may account for his ghastly looks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>She flattered herself that she had entirely squelched
any coquettish interest Viola might have in the newcomer,
deeming it her duty to do so, for though the
girl was to be married in a week, her aunt had full
confidence in her ability to break another heart in that
brief space of time if she took it into her head to do it.</p>

<p>But Viola was listening carelessly, her thoughts all
with Philip, who had said he would call on his way
to the Capitol this morning.</p>

<p>He came presently, and was ushered into the morning-room,
from which Aunt Edwina discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p>Viola met her lover with a glad smile and blush and
did not refuse the kiss he pressed on her dewy red lips.</p>

<p>“We are banished from the library because papa
has a man doing some work for him in there,” she
said. “Sit down, Philip, dear, while I scold you for
breaking your engagement to come last night.”</p>

<p>“I sent you a note explaining that my cousin, Mrs.
Wellford, had sent for me,” Professor Desha answered,
sitting down on the satin divan by her side and
pressing the soft, jeweled hand she slipped into his so
confidingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I received your note. Of course I excused
you, though I missed you very much!” Viola cried,
with her most sweetly reproachful air. Then she gave
a slight start, and added: “Dearest, how pale you are!
What is wrong? Are you ill?”</p>

<p>Professor Desha did indeed look pale and heavy-eyed,
and his voice sounded strange as he answered:</p>

<p>“I am sorry you noticed it; but—I am not feeling
very well. I had a bad night; was restless, and scarcely
slept at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>His grave blue eyes searched her face closely, plaintively,
as if some jealous doubt haunted his mind;
but the perfect tenderness and joy of her manner were
enough to dissipate any fears, and presently she
charmed him from the gray mood in which he had
entered her presence.</p>

<p>Her gayety cost her an effort, too, for she was
secretly frightened when she saw what a shadow
lurked in his grave blue eyes. She was a coward at
heart, always dreading for him to find out something
she feared for him to know.</p>

<p>Had she guessed what was in his thoughts, as he sat
so quietly by her side, she must have fallen down fainting
at his feet in her remorse and shame.</p>

<p>Ruby Wellford had played a clever card in her
longing to defeat Viola, and a thorn was planted in
his manly heart that would ache there many a day.</p>

<p>But he had not showed his cousin the pain he had
felt, he had simply answered:</p>

<p>“I am sorry for the poor young man. I dare say
that Viola was more thoughtless than wilfully wicked.
She is so young, you know, and has missed a mother’s
care.”</p>

<p>“Philip, you do not mean that you will go on dangling
after the girl after hearing this—this appalling
story!” she cried, almost indignantly.</p>

<p>Then he took her hand and said, very gently and
kindly:</p>

<p>“Ruby, you know I appreciate your kindness, and
am sorry Viola has flirted so recklessly, but—but she
will never break my heart.”</p>

<p>“But, Phil, every one is saying that you are her
latest victim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“Her latest and her last,” he replied, significantly;
and as she cried out that she did not understand, he
added: “You have told me a secret, and I will return
your confidence. I promised Viola to keep it till tomorrow,
but I do not think she would care if I told
you now—under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“What is your secret?” she cried eagerly, and he
answered, proudly:</p>

<p>“Only this: you will receive our wedding-cards
tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Yours—and Viola’s! Do you mean it really,
Phil?” she demanded, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true. We have been engaged ever since
January, but Viola wished to keep it secret to spring a
great sensation on her friends.”</p>

<p>“She will certainly succeed, for no one ever dreamed
she had a heart!” exclaimed the lady; then noticing
how very pale he had grown, she added, repentantly:
“Dear Phil, forgive me for my blundering! If I had
dreamed how matters really stood, I would rather have
bitten off the extreme end of my tongue than have
tattled to you about young Merrington.”</p>

<p>“I forgive you, Ruby. You thought you were acting
for my good, and I appreciate it,” he replied in a hollow
voice, and left the house to spend the restless night
that sent him to Viola’s side so pale and serious-looking
the next morning.</p>

<p>Beautiful Viola, who knew so well how to charm
every heart, did not rest till she had chased the
shadows from her lover’s brow.</p>

<p>“You are tired of my chatter. Come, I will sing to
you,” she cried, going with him to the music-room that
adjoined the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell, working diligently among her father’s
books, lifted his dark, finely shaped head to listen, and
the voice sounded to him like an angel’s, it was so
clear and sweet.</p>

<p>“It is Miss Van Lew, I suppose. How rarely she
is gifted—queen of song and love and beauty!” he
thought; for although he was a stranger to Viola, he
had seen her more than once, and the story of her
coquetry had reached his ears.</p>

<p>He worked on diligently, but he did not lose one note
of her sweet music, or one word of her songs.</p>

<p>“She must be singing to some favored lover,” he
said to himself, marking the tenderness that freighted
her voice.</p>

<p>By and by the music ceased, and he heard them
going out of the room, but he did not know that the
girl had said:</p>

<p>“I must stop, for perhaps I am disturbing the young
man in the library. Oh, Philip, would it not be great
fun to pretend to go in there for a book just to see
what he looks like?”</p>

<p>“By no means, Viola. I am sure it would appear
to him like vulgar curiosity,” he replied, almost sharply,
bringing a quick blush to her brow.</p>

<p>He went away soon after, and Viola left the room
to go upstairs to examine some new things just arrived.</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell was just going out to his midday
luncheon, and they encountered each other in the wide
hall.</p>

<p>It gave each of them a queer start; but Viola rallied
quickly, saying, kindly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“At your service, Miss Van Lew,” he replied, with
a distant, but most courteous bow, and a swift glance
quickly withdrawn as he hurried to the door and
passed out.</p>

<p>Viola went slowly up the broad steps to her own
apartments, her fair cheeks burning with the blush
that had colored them at his sudden glance.</p>

<p>“How silly I am—blushing like a school-girl under
a stranger’s glance,” she thought, vexedly. “But really—what
splendid, large black eyes! They gave me a
positive thrill!”</p>

<p>Viola having made the acquaintance of Rolfe Maxwell
thus accidentally, saw him several times afterward,
twice when she tripped into the library for a book she
wanted, begging in sweetest accents that he would
not mind her coming, and several times when they simply
passed each other in the hall with polite bows of
recognition, undreaming yet of the part each was
fated to play in the other’s life. He knew that she
was going to be married directly, and that the house
was in confusion with the preparations, and he worked
as hard as he could to get through with his task,
coming back in the evenings and writing sometimes
till almost midnight.</p>

<p>So the days slipped quickly by till it was Viola’s
wedding-eve.</p>

<p>Tomorrow at high noon she was to be married from
a fashionable church, attended by some of the prettiest
girls in her set as maids of honor. They were
more than anxious to perform this service for Viola
in their eagerness to see the irresistible young beauty
safely married off out of their way.</p>

<p>Everything was in readiness; the bridal-gown—a
dream of snow-white beauty, brocaded satin, with
priceless point-lace veil—was perfect; the bridal-pearls—her
father’s gift—exquisite. Her trunks
were packed with beautiful robes, the envy of all her
feminine friends.</p>

<p>She sat alone that evening, waiting for Philip, who
had promised to make a short call, even though it was
the bridal-eve, and Aunt Edwina had hinted that
Viola ought to have a long beauty sleep.</p>

<p>Against the background of her dark-blue silk, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
its creamy laces, her fair face shone like a delicate
flower, smiles on her lips and joy in her eyes.</p>

<p>She said to herself that she was the happiest girl
in the wide world.</p>

<p>She knew she did not quite deserve it, because she
had certainly brought some unhappiness into others’
lives through her willful coquetries; but that was all
past and done with now, and she was going to be a
better girl.</p>

<p>She did not remember what one of the great masters
of literature has written:</p>

<p>“Consequences are unpitying.”</p>

<p>As her wedding-day came so near, with its attendant
hurry and excitement, she forgot the forebodings
of evil that had tortured her a few weeks ago.
Every unpleasant thought had taken wing. She forgot
Florian and remembered only Philip.</p>

<p>Glancing around the luxurious room that seemed
so lonely without him, she tapped her dainty foot
impatiently, murmuring:</p>

<p>“I wish he would come!”</p>

<p>As if in answer to her aspiration, she heard a ring
at the front door, and some one being ushered into
the hall.</p>

<p>With a muffled heart-beat of joy, Viola sprang to
her feet, waiting with shining eyes and parted, smiling
lips for the entrance of her lover.</p>

<p>The heavy curtains at the door were thrust aside
by an eager white hand, and he stepped quickly
over the threshold toward the eager, waiting girl,
catching her to his heart, pressing passionate lips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
to hers, then holding her off to gaze fondly into her
glorious eyes while he murmured, thrillingly:</p>

<p>“My love—my love!”</p>

<p>From the girl’s white lips came a stifled moan of
pain as if he had thrust a dagger into her heart.</p>

<p>For the voice was not Philip Desha’s, and instead
of his calm, tender blue eyes she met the dark, sparkling
gaze of Florian Gay.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She could never explain to herself afterward why
she did not faint on the spot, for all her strength
seemed to fail her, and her face grew as white as
the face of a corpse. It must have been the horrible
fear of Philip coming at any moment and surprising
her in the midst of a terrible interview with
her jilted lover. It flashed over her mind that she
must get him away as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Florian Gay cried out in tender alarm:</p>

<p>“Viola, my darling, how you tremble, and how
pale your sweet face has grown! I did not mean to
shock you so; I only meant to give you a pleasant
surprise. Sit here on the sofa, darling, and you
will be better in a moment,” seating himself by her
side, and gazing at her with fond eyes before whose
glance she shrank in infinite misery.</p>

<p>“When—when—did you come?” she faltered, in a
dying voice.</p>

<p>“I only reached Washington an hour ago. Father
died at Carlsbad, and mother and I brought him
home at once for burial. The funeral will be at
noon to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Viola shuddered at his words. At noon to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
she was to be married! What a strange coincidence!
How was she going to tell him the awful
truth?</p>

<p>Despair made her reckless, desperate, cruel.</p>

<p>There was no time to break it gently, for at any
moment Philip might arrive—Philip, his successful
rival.</p>

<p>She caught her breath with a great strangling
gasp of fear, and pushed him back with frantic, white
hands as he leaned forward to offer a caress.</p>

<p>“Do not touch me—do not touch me! I—I—love—you
no longer, Florian!” she cried out wildly.</p>

<p>“Viola!”</p>

<p>“It is true,” she went on cruelly. “You stayed away
so long that my fancy for you died. I do not think
it ever was real love, for—for—my heart soon turned
to another—and—and—you must go away now, Florian,
and there is no use getting angry and reproaching
me—it is too late to do anything but forgive me and
wish me joy! My wedding-cards are out—and—I am
to be married at noon tomorrow!”</p>

<p>Was ever such cruel truth blurted out so rudely to
a fond, trusting lover?</p>

<p>Florian Gay sat listening in an awful, incredulous
silence like one stiffened into stone, his dark, gleaming
eyes fixed on her pallid face with its strange expression,
half fear, half defiance.</p>

<p>She waited a minute for him to speak, then added
imploringly:</p>

<p>“Please go away now, Florian—please, please! I
am very, very sorry to have caused you pain; but it can
not be helped now, and I hope you will soon get over it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Oh, Florian, there is no use staying to reproach me!
Oh, go, go, go!—only go!”</p>

<p>Desperate with anxiety, she pointed to the door, and
the wronged lover slowly rose, his burning eyes still
fixed on her fatally lovely face.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” she cried, in a tone of relief, as she
saw that he was going.</p>

<p>Then he spoke in a strange and hollow voice:</p>

<p>“So you really mean it, Viola? This is not an ill-timed
jest?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no, it is the fatal truth!” she answered,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Why did you not write to me, Viola?” his voice
sharp with anguish.</p>

<p>“I meant to—but I feared your anger—I thought I
would wait till after my marriage.”</p>

<p>“Cruel heart!” he muttered, darkly, a soul’s despair
in the burning, dark eyes he fixed on her excited face.</p>

<p>“Go!” she answered, eagerly, pointing to the door.</p>

<p>But instead of obeying, he strode forward, clutching
her extended wrist in a grasp of steel.</p>

<p>Bending his dark head, he almost hissed in her ear:</p>

<p>“My rival—his name?”</p>

<p>“I will not tell you! Release my wrist!” defiantly.</p>

<p>“You will gain nothing by your silence. I will find
it out, and woe be the traitor who stole you from me,
beautiful, accursed coquette! My God! how false you
are! Promising long ago to marry me, then binding
me to silence that you might be free to ensnare other
hearts! Do you remember the tender, loving words
you used to write me before your fickle heart grew
cold? I have them now, those letters warm against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
my breast! I will show them to your new conquest before
I lay him dead at my feet!” hissed the outraged
lover, giving way to a tempest of rage and revenge, as
he threw her wrist from him so violently that she almost
fell.</p>

<p>Steadying herself against the back of a chair, Viola
cried, in terror:</p>

<p>“Oh, you will not dare to do this dastardly thing!
You will not expose the weakness of a thoughtless
girl who fancied that she loved you and found out she
was mistaken. Surely that is no crime! Do you think
his heart would turn against me so easily? Ah! no,
no, no! Besides, why should you wish to wound him
with this knowledge? He knew nothing of my engagement
to you. He is not to blame for anything, unless
you call his loving me a fault. You shall not betray
me,” her eyes flashing luridly. “If you do I will fight
you to the bitter end. I will deny your accusations!”</p>

<p>“But you can not deny your letters!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Florian, give them to me!” her defiance melting
into fear.</p>

<p>The cruel wrong he had suffered at her hands made
him merciless.</p>

<p>“You shall never have them! They will help me to
revenge, wicked, false-hearted girl!” he almost hissed,
rushing madly from her presence out into the bleak
March night, a man whose heart and hopes had been
blasted in an hour.</p>

<p>Viola sank into a chair, her eyes wild, her face
death-white, her heart beating to suffocation.</p>

<p>Clasping her white jeweled hands prayerfully, she
lifted her face, sobbing despairingly:</p>

<p>“God help and pity me, and save me from the retribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
my sins have brought upon me! Oh, what
shall I do—what shall I do? Suppose he meets Philip
on the threshold coming in. He will tell him all, unknowing
that Philip is his successful rival. Oh, may
Heaven hinder my dear love from coming here tonight!”</p>

<p>“Too late! I am here!” answered a deep, stern
voice; and Philip Desha advanced through a door leading
from the morning-room.</p>

<p>Viola’s beautiful eyes, black now with excitement,
turned wildly on her lover’s face, and she staggered
toward him with outstretched hands, faltering piteously:</p>

<p>“Dear Philip, I—I am ill!”</p>

<p>Silently he took the offered hands and led her to a
large easy-chair. Then allowing the cold little fingers
to drop from his chilly hold, he stepped back a pace
and stood with his arms folded across his breast, regarding
her with a pale, stern face, whose expression
was more eloquent than words.</p>

<p>No need for her to wonder if he had heard her interview
with Florian Gay.</p>

<p>His cold avoidance, his reproachful face, spoke
volumes.</p>

<p>“Philip!” she wailed, despairingly, then buried her
shamed face in her jeweled hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Then he spoke, in a cold, hard voice she scarcely
recognized:</p>

<p>“I heard everything, Viola. When the servant admitted
me he said you already had a caller. So I went
into the little morning sitting-room to wait till he went
away, not dreaming it was my friend Florian. I heard
your voices—they were raised in excitement so that I
could not avoid it. Every word sank like lead on my
heart!”</p>

<p>Hot tears sprang to her eyes and streamed through
her fingers as she wondered what mercy she was to
expect from her proud, high-minded lover who considered
flirting a deadly sin.</p>

<p>He was very angry, she knew from his face and his
attitude. She would have to be very humble and repentant
to win his forgiveness.</p>

<p>She stole a glance at his face through her fingers,
and saw that he was waiting for her to speak.</p>

<p>She could think of only one word, and it came pleadingly,
imploringly:</p>

<p>“Forgive!”</p>

<p>Then her lashes fell, and she waited in humble
silence, hearing in the stillness her own muffled heart-beats.</p>

<p>Pale, stern, handsome Philip Desha stood looking
at the girl like her avenging Nemesis.</p>

<p>He spoke, and she started at the hollow tone of his
voice.</p>

<p>“Viola, how can you expect forgiveness for your
cruelty?”</p>

<p>She murmured, faintly:</p>

<p>“I did not intend to be cruel, but my heart wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
from him to you! Oh, Philip, can that be a
crime in your eyes?”</p>

<p>“Not that, Viola, but your deceit. When I asked
you to marry me, why did you not confess your previous
engagement, and tell me you would ask Florian
to release you? That would have been the honest way,
and my love could have forgiven that much, but this
treachery <i>never</i>!”</p>

<p>“Philip!” incredulously, holding out her beautiful
arms imploringly, her streaming eyes upturned in
prayerful entreaty.</p>

<p>But her love, her penitence, and her beauty did
not move the honest heart of her outraged lover to
forgiveness.</p>

<p>He said, icily:</p>

<p>“Do not humble yourself to plead to me, Viola. My
heart seems frozen within me—frozen by the discovery
of your unworthiness.”</p>

<p>She began to be vaguely frightened at his harshness.
How dare he scold her now, he who was to be her husband
tomorrow!</p>

<p>A flash of pride shone through her tears, and she
exclaimed, rashly:</p>

<p>“I will not let you scold me, Philip. Whatever
I did, it was for your sake—because I loved you!”</p>

<p>He answered, scathingly:</p>

<p>“Was it for my sake, then, you drove young George
Merrington to suicide?”</p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven! how came you by that knowledge,
Philip?” she groaned.</p>

<p>“No matter how, Viola, so that you do not deny
it. For a week that knowledge has lain heavy as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
stone on my heart. I have asked myself how I could
wed a woman with so cruel a nature that she drove
men mad just to gratify her insatiate vanity. You
must know that my ideal of true womanhood is based
on angelic sweetness, tenderness, and compassion, and
the knowledge of your faults was a shock I could
barely endure. But our wedding-day was near, and
my love for you triumphed over my reason. I made
all possible excuses for you, and let things drift on
until tonight.”</p>

<p>Viola bowed her head without a word, since he had
told her that pleading was useless. She could only
listen in terrified silence, wondering whither his words
were tending.</p>

<p>He paused a moment, cleared his throat nervously,
and proceeded:</p>

<p>“The cruelty of the treatment accorded Florian Gay
transcends your coquetry with young Merrington. I
can find no fitting words to describe your conduct. Besides,
you have just said you would not permit me to
scold you. So it only remains for me to say that I
fear a girl who flirts so shamelessly before marriage
could not refrain from it afterwards. I could not trust
and respect her as my wife.”</p>

<p>No answer from Viola, crouching speechless in her
chair, and he continued, sadly but firmly:</p>

<p>“These are bitter words, and I regret the bitter occasion
for them, but—Miss Van Lew, I can never be
your husband!”</p>

<p>The listening statue started into indignant, palpitating
life.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven! you would break faith with me now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
at the last hour—expose me to open shame! A jilted
bride!”</p>

<p>“Forbid the thought,” he answered, quickly. “On
my head fall all the obloquy. You can tell the world
that we quarreled bitterly this evening, and that you
refused to marry me. That will clear up everything.
No one,” bitterly, “will discredit this new proof of
Miss Van Lew’s fickleness and heartlessness and love
of sensation.”</p>

<p>He waited a moment for the silent, statue-like figure
to speak, but from the tense white lips came not a
word, either of blame or of entreaty, so with a slight,
cold bow, Philip Desha passed from her presence out
into the cold March night, as Florian Gay had done but
a little while before, his heart as crushed and heavy
as Florian’s own, but true to his high ideals of noble
womanhood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Viola did not move from her chair for fifteen
minutes. She sat still as a statue, the only sign of life
in her gleaming, dark eyes, where pride and despair alternately
struggled for expression.</p>

<p>It was the bitterest and most tragic hour her brilliant
life had ever known.</p>

<p>She had lost the prize she had risked so much to win—lost
the love that was more to her than Heaven.</p>

<p>He despised her now, had thrown her aside in scorn.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the whole world would find it out, and
mock at her misery, pointing the gibing finger of scorn
at the young bride jilted at the altar.</p>

<p>She rose at last, muttering four baleful words:</p>

<p>“How I hate him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Crossing to a desk, she caught up a pen and dashed
off nervously a few incoherent words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Florian</span>,—He—the man I was to marry—was
in the next room, and heard all our conversation
tonight. We quarreled bitterly, and—our engagement
is broken off. There will be no wedding to-morrow,
unless you will forgive me and take his place. Will
you, Florian, to save me the notoriety of a broken-off
marriage? Besides I hate him now—and it will be
easy to teach me to love you again as I used to do.</p>

<p>“Will you come at once and see me, dear Florian,
or send a message by bearer?</p>

<p class="sigprefix">“Your repentant</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Viola</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having dispatched the message by a safe bearer,
she hastened to her room to remove as well as possible
all traces of her terrible agitation. Florian should
not know the real truth of the broken engagement.</p>

<p>She would make him think that the sight of him had
reawakened all the old love in her heart.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she would punish false, cruel Philip in the
bitterest fashion! Pride enthroned itself in her heart.</p>

<p>The messenger returned swiftly, but Florian did not
come. He had sent a note, that she tore open with
eager fingers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Van Lew</span>,—I decline with contempt the
offer to fill a truant bridegroom’s place to-morrow. I
have no doubt he has deserted you in disgust at learning
your treachery to me, and I rejoice at your misfortune!</p>

</div>

<p class="center">“I DROVE POOR VIOLA TO HER DEATH!”</p>


<p>“Was ever any beautiful, thoughtless young girl
more cruelly punished for the fault of coquetry?”
thought Viola, as she buried her hot, burning face in
her hands, her heart swelling with rage against Florian
and Philip.</p>

<p>“I hate them both!” she sobbed, miserably, in her
bitter defeat, not comprehending yet the full enormity
of the conduct that had roused her two lovers to resentment.</p>

<p>Why, at the sea-shore last summer she had known a
pretty girl from Chicago that was engaged to four
young men at once, and played them off against one
another in the most skillful fashion, to the amusement
of all her girl friends who were in the secret.</p>

<p>Viola caught herself wondering now how the pretty
flirt had ever got out of the scrape.</p>

<p>Then her thoughts came back to her own pitiful
plight. How was she ever going to face to-morrow?</p>

<p>True, she might take Philip’s advice and say they
had quarreled, and she had thrown him over. But the
thought of her father’s anger made her shudder with
fear, and her passionate pride revolted at telling him
the real truth—that she had been deserted by Philip
and scorned by Florian.</p>

<p>No; she dare not go to her father with either story,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the humiliating truth, or the clever fiction suggested by
Desha.</p>

<p>In either case his wrath would be something terrible.</p>

<p>She had learned this when he upbraided her in the
case of George Merrington.</p>

<p>She was thankful that Aunt Edwina, weary of the
preparations for to-morrow, had retired early to her
room. No one could know aught of the shameful
humiliation that had come to her to-night—no one but
those two heartless ones who had brought this irredeemable
woe to her hitherto careless happy life.</p>

<p>Viola sat still in her chair, crushing Florian’s harsh
note between her icy fingers, her eyes staring blankly
before her out of her deathly white face, seeing in
fancy the wreck of her life lying in ruins at her feet.</p>

<p>What a sensation there would be to-morrow when
she had to face every one with the declaration that
there would be no wedding!</p>

<p>How could she ever face Aunt Edwina’s gentle surprise
and persistent curiosity, her father’s wrath, and
the wonder and the veiled mockery of her little social
world?</p>

<p>She had been so proud, so haughty—and now her
pride was leveled in the dust.</p>

<p>And she was too angry for repentance, too resentful
to accept her fate.</p>

<p>A passionate longing to punish Desha for his desertion
throbbed at her heart, but alas! she was helpless.
With Florian’s help she might have done it—might
still have been wedded to-morrow, and turned
the exchange of bridegrooms into a jest, baffling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
world’s curiosity, and thwarting Desha’s intentions—but
now the thought of to-morrow drove her mad.
How could she face its keen humiliation and live?</p>

<p>She to whom life had always been so fair and beautiful
suddenly found it a dark and gloomy spot from
which she shrank in blind terror, madly longing for
death.</p>

<p>“I wish I was dead!” she groaned in her tearless despair
and dread of to-morrow.</p>

<p>She felt a terrible loneliness, a feeling that there was
no one on earth to whom she could turn for help or
pity in this dark, dark hour when all the joy of her life
had fallen to her feet in ruins.</p>

<p>She rose, pacing up and down the floor with interlocked
hands and blazing eyes. Half crazed with the
sudden shock of trouble, Viola’s thoughts took a sudden,
desperate turn, paltered with an awful temptation.</p>

<p>She murmured hollowly:</p>

<p>“I can not bear my pain and live! Death were better.”</p>

<p>Death would still the aching of the weary head, the
throbbing of the tortured heart, save her from tomorrow.</p>

<p>If she could only die, the secret of her cruel humiliation
would die with her—neither Philip Desha nor
Florian Gay would dare stand up in the face of the
pitying world and say: “I drove poor Viola to her
death.”</p>

<p>They would be ashamed and afraid of condemnation.
Remorse would seize their hearts, their old love
would return and overwhelm them with grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>If she only could get some morphine, she could soon
end her sorrow. Death would come gently, painlessly.</p>

<p>When they called her in the morning she would not
answer, her soul would have slipped away gently in
the night.</p>

<p>They would dress her in the beautiful bridal gown,
cover her coffin with flowers, and lay her in the earth,
weeping for the fair young life so untimely ended.</p>

<p>Viola sobbed aloud at this moving picture; but it did
not deter her from the grim resolve that took possession
of her distraught mind.</p>

<p>Stealing unnoticed to her room, she slipped on a
warm seal-skin jacket and donned a cap to match,
drawing a close veil over her face.</p>

<p>Then slipping down to a rear entrance, she left the
house unperceived, by a gate the servants used, intent
on reaching the drug store on the corner to procure the
morphine.</p>

<p>Her face was deathly pale, her lips writhed in pain,
her eyes gleamed wildly with her desperate purpose to
baffle fate that used her so cruelly.</p>

<p>She did not observe as she closed the gate that a
gentleman had run down the steps of her home and
walked briskly to the corner, waiting there for an electric
car.</p>

<p>It was a quiet street and seemingly deserted this cold
March night, so that he observed with surprise the
slender, graceful figure flitting before him, noting with
a start that it looked like Miss Van Lew.</p>

<p>She darted into the drug store, and curiosity made
him draw near the door to satisfy his doubts.</p>

<p>He heard the sweet musical voice, to whose tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
songs he had listened in rapture every day, asking in
hoarse, unnatural accents for morphine, and then the
answer of the clerk who said that he could not sell such
a dangerous drug without a doctor’s prescription.</p>

<p>Viola turned silently and went out into the street,
passing Rolfe Maxwell without perceiving him, in the
absorption of her misery.</p>

<p>She stood a moment watching the electric car now
bearing swiftly down toward the corner, and the young
man thought as she advanced into the street, that she
was about to signal it.</p>

<p>He said to himself in perplexity:</p>

<p>“What a strange freak for Miss Van Lew, boarding
an electric car at ten o’clock at night to go after morphine!
Yet there is no one sick at her house, as I am
aware.”</p>

<p>Perplexed and uneasy, he moved forward after her
and just then a terrible thing happened.</p>

<p>Viola, mad with misery, and assailed by an irresistible
temptation, threw herself recklessly across the
track, where the advancing wheels of the car would
in another moment crush out her life.</p>

<p>The truth flashed on him in lightning horror. The
girl intended to commit suicide.</p>

<p>It was dark just there, and the conductor had not
perceived her frantic deed. What was to save the poor
girl from instant death as the swift engine of destruction
rushed down upon her prostrate form?</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell’s heart seemed to stand still with horror.
Was it possible to save her now? to save her or
only to meet death in the effort?</p>

<p>He sprang after her with outstretched hand, clutching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
her skirts, dragging her back, clearing the way just
as the car rushed past, grazing his bowed head, and
knocking him down.</p>

<p>Strange to say no one had witnessed the terrible
tragedy so bravely avoided. Only the silent stars
looked down on the cold street upon Viola and her rescuer
struggling to their feet, the girl uninjured, the
man slightly dazed from a blow on the head.</p>

<p>He clutched her arm tightly and led her to the pavement,
saying sternly:</p>

<p>“I have saved you from yourself at the risk of my
own life; but, Miss Van Lew, why did you attempt
this terrible deed?”</p>

<p>The girl trembled, shuddered, and her great somber
eyes flared up to his face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell!” she exclaimed, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes, Rolfe Maxwell,” he answered. “I was just
leaving your father’s house and I saw you go into the
drug store, and when you failed to get morphine you
threw yourself in front of that advancing car. Why
did you do it, Miss Van Lew, you whom we supposed
to be the happiest girl in the world?”</p>

<p>His voice was stern, yet a thrill of such tender anxiety
ran through it that she felt instinctively he was
her friend. Clinging to him piteously, she sobbed:</p>

<p>“Oh, do not scold me! I am so unhappy!”</p>

<p>The piteous voice went to his heart, and as they
stood there together, she trembling like a leaf as she
clung to him, he could not resist pressing the little
hand on his arm, and answering, gently:</p>

<p>“I did not wish to be harsh with you, but I do not
understand, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Viola was frightened almost to death. She faltered:</p>

<p>“I can not explain. I can only confess that I was
very unhappy, and wished to die! You will not tell
papa, will you?”</p>

<p>“I must do so in order that you may be watched to
prevent another attempt at suicide,” he replied,
gravely; adding: “May I take you home now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not yet, please! I am afraid—afraid!” she
wailed, dreading her father’s wrath. “Oh, let us walk
along the streets awhile, please.”</p>

<p>She thought she could persuade him to keep her secret,
but he was resolute in taking her home and telling
her father.</p>

<p>“I dare not trust you unless you promise not to
make such another attempt,” he said, so firmly that
she cried, petulantly:</p>

<p>“Who are you that dares assume authority over
me?”</p>

<p>“I am your true friend, I hope, Miss Van Lew, and
I would not willingly see your fair young life thrown
away.”</p>

<p>She startled him by murmuring:</p>

<p>“My friend! Come, I like that word! All other
men have been my lovers!”</p>

<p>She did not guess how his heart beat as he answered:</p>

<p>“I could be your lover, too, Miss Van Lew, but
fate is against me. You seem to need a friend. Let
me hold that precious place.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly along the street, her trembling
hand drawn through his arm. In spite of all her trouble
Viola could not help seeing how tall and handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
he was, with glorious dark eyes that had given her a
strange, delicious thrill every time she met their earnest
glance.</p>

<p>She had a subtle feeling that here was a true heart—one
to rest on and confide in, sure of pity and sympathy.</p>

<p>She faltered, weakly:</p>

<p>“You—you would not wish to be my friend if you
knew me well. There are—are”—gaspingly—“men
who hate me because I—I used to flirt when I did not
know it was very cruel.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A COUP D’ÉTAT.</p>


<p>“Poor little girl!” murmured Rolfe Maxwell, very
softly; and he could not help pressing the little hand
that lay upon his arm.</p>

<p>The tenderness sank into Viola’s heart, so hungry
for pity and sympathy.</p>

<p>She sighed heavily, and walked along by his side
in silence a few minutes, without thinking how strange
her position was—walking at this time of night with
Rolfe Maxwell, her father’s employe, and almost a
stranger to herself.</p>

<p>In the distraught state of her mind nothing seemed
strange or out of the way now.</p>

<p>The man’s gentleness and sympathy stole like balm
into her aching heart and melted it, where coldness and
blame would have steeled it into pride and anger.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean,” she murmured in a wistful
voice such as no one had ever heard from her before,
“that you really want to be my friend, that you would
help me out of my trouble—for indeed I have a great
trouble—if you could?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean it; for I am very sorry for you, Miss
Van Lew. I will do anything in the world to help you,
if you will only tell me how,” he returned, gently and
encouragingly, with an earnestness that wooed her
confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Viola was so proud that she wanted to keep her
humiliating secret from the whole world, and would
not confide it even to her aunt and father; but, obeying
the magnetic influence of the moment, she opened
her whole passionate heart to this stranger.</p>

<p>She did not spare herself; she did not gloss over
anything; she accused herself as if she had been some
one else; and then she waited for his decision, after
saying, piteously:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will think that I fully deserve my
punishment.”</p>

<p>She did not know herself how piteously she awaited
his reply, crushed and humiliated by the experiences of
the night, and longing for something to rehabilitate
herself in her own esteem. Her whole heart seemed
to hang tremblingly on his next words.</p>

<p>Would he still proclaim himself her friend when he
knew what a wicked little flirt she had been, and how
cruelly she had been punished?</p>

<p>But Rolfe Maxwell had heard of her coquetries long
before, and had always made excuses for her in his
heart.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that one so rarely gifted by nature
and fortune could not be entirely to blame. Royally
dowered with beauty and fascination, she commanded
love without seeking it; and perhaps, in her youth and
innocence, she did not indeed value the emotion at its
true worth. Had she not confessed to him her dismay
at her father’s lecture, and the changed life she
had led afterward, save for her cowardice in confessing
the truth to Florian?</p>

<p>So he replied, warmly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“Your punishment was greater than the offense warranted.
I should say that Professor Desha and Florian
Gay were both lacking in some of the elements of true
manliness, or they never could have served you so ill
a turn. I should say that your father would be perfectly
right to call Desha to account.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, never! Papa must never know how
I have been treated. But I am so glad you take my
part, that you think they were to blame!” cried poor
Viola, gratefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I take your part. You have been shamefully
treated; but I should say that in my opinion you are
well rid of both of the poltroons. Such love as theirs
was not worth having,” the young man cried, indignantly;
adding: “But I have said I would be your
friend. Trust me now, and tell me what I can do to
help you. Perhaps if I should go and reason the case
with Philip Desha, he might stoop from his haughty
pedestal and return to his allegiance.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would permit you? Never!” her
form trembling with indignation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then, you would not mind my speaking to
Florian Gay?”</p>

<p>“Sue to those monsters? Never! As for Florian,
I did not want him anyway. It was only—only—to
save myself from tomorrow’s sensation, and to punish
Desha,” she half-sobbed, growing hysterical in the
realization of the impending morrow. “Oh, why did I
not die?” she moaned, wildly.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, would you sacrifice yourself
for such ignoble wretches?” he remonstrated, gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“I have told you I can not face tomorrow!” she
groaned.</p>

<p>“You shall!” He caught his breath quickly. “I
have a plan—rather a desperate one—to help you out
of your difficulty, if you can consider it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, her heart bounding out of the gulf
of black despair up into the light of hope.</p>

<p>“It is only a suggestion, mind. You are not obliged
to take my advice. Suppose you married some other
man tonight, and get a paragraph into the morning
papers making it appear you eloped with a favored
suitor and left Desha in the lurch.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, impulsively again; and he continued:</p>

<p>“There would be no one to contradict this story,
because Desha and Gay would surely be ashamed to
confess their dastardly share in driving you to desperation.
Thus your pride would be saved, and no one the
wiser, your reputation for coquetry making it easy for
the public to accept the story.”</p>

<p>Viola’s laugh rang out hysterically.</p>

<p>“Capital! How clever you are, Mr. Maxwell!”</p>

<p>“Then you like the idea of my little <i>coup d’état</i>?”</p>

<p>“Immensely!” she cried, recklessly. “But a man
will be necessary to our success. Where shall we find
him?”</p>

<p>Was it a daring challenge that rang in her voice?</p>

<p>His heart leaped wildly against her arm, and then
he asked, in a thick, agitated voice:</p>

<p>“How would young George Merrington suit you,
Miss Van Lew?”</p>

<p>“Why, he is only a lovesick boy! Besides, I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
not go and ask him to marry me! I have been refused
by two men already tonight, and am discouraged with
my luck!” Viola answered, petulantly.</p>

<p>There was silence between them for a few minutes;
then he murmured, low and hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“There are others, Miss Van Lew.”</p>

<p>“You mean—” she said, catching her breath with a
sort of gasp of surprise; and he answered, passionately:</p>

<p>“My heart is at your feet!”</p>

<p>Viola’s heart throbbed strangely as she caught the
meaning of her companion’s passionate speech, but to
save her life she could not utter a word. She was
overpowered by a sudden bashfulness, as if she had
provoked the declaration by too eager encouragement.
In the gloom of the night she felt her cheeks burn like
fire.</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell remained silent too for a moment, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
if startled at his own presumptuousness, then, seeing
she would not speak, continued vehemently:</p>

<p>“Am I too bold? Believe me, I love you ardently,
but I should never have dared to tell you so, only—only—to
help you, if you so choose, out of the—difficulty—which
troubles you so greatly. I am poor, and
I have nothing to offer you but a true heart and an
untarnished name. But if you will marry me, Viola—may
I call you that?—I will toil as never man toiled
before to win fame and fortune for my darling.”</p>

<p>He paused, breathless, his splendid eyes shining
down upon her with mingled hope and fear, lest she
should upbraid him for his boldness.</p>

<p>But still Viola paced slowly by his side along the
gloomy street, past the long rows of frowning red-brick
houses without a word, and he took heart of
grace to continue gravely:</p>

<p>“Do not answer until you look clearly into the future.
If you go home now and reconcile yourself to
your trouble, it will soon blow over, and you may perhaps
soon become reconciled to your lover and be happy.
On the other hand, if you marry me, your father
will perhaps be offended beyond forgiveness; he will
disinherit you, and you will suffer the hardships of a
poor man’s wife, without the sweet, wifely tenderness
that would make your lot bearable, unless in time you
could learn to love me.”</p>

<p>He heard a long, quivering sigh, but no word, and
he went on gently:</p>

<p>“I would be very patient, and not try to force your
love, dear. I have an offer to go to Cuba to the seat
of war as reporter for a leading newspaper here, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
I would accept it and go away at once, leaving you
here in my humble home with my dear, kind mother
and my sweet cousin Mae, an orphan girl who lives
with us. I know they would love you for my sake, and
while I was away, your heart might grow toward me
by the magnetic force of my own passion, till at last
we were drawn together by mutual love.”</p>

<p>The eloquent voice paused, and Viola said, low and
very faintly:</p>

<p>“How good you are to me.”</p>

<p>He had hardly dared hope that she would accept
him, perhaps he knew it was best she should not, yet
her words chilled his heart.</p>

<p>“But you refuse me?” he asked, in a broken voice.</p>

<p>To his joy and surprise her small hand eagerly
pressed his arm, and she answered very low:</p>

<p>“No, I will marry you, and I thank you for your
offer, for it is the best way out of my trouble, and will
help me to revenge myself on Philip and Florian.”</p>

<p>It was not a very flattering acceptance, he felt—not
a word for himself, but only a note of rejoicing for
her triumph that was to be gained by making a bridge
of another man’s heart to reach her longed-for revenge.</p>

<p>She added in a moment, bitterly:</p>

<p>“I do not believe that either one of them has ceased
to love me, and when they come to their senses and
find out I am married to another, they will suffer all
the pangs they caused my heart.”</p>

<p>And she laughed hollowly at her prospective revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“May Heaven help me to win your heart, Viola, and
show you the difference between true love and false!
And now, as it is getting late, perhaps we had better
seek a minister to marry us.”</p>

<p>She started, laughed hysterically, but answered,
eagerly:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is there any minister you prefer?”</p>

<p>“No,” carelessly.</p>

<p>“Then we will go to the rectory of All Souls’
Church; it is only about two blocks from here. Doctor
Meade is a friend of mine, and will make no difficulty
about performing the ceremony. Then we will write
out the notice we desire for the morning papers, and
he will have it sent to the offices while I take you to
my home.”</p>

<p>They paused at the steps of the rectory, and he said,
tenderly:</p>

<p>“It is not too late to draw back yet, Viola.”</p>

<p>“There is no drawing back for me!”</p>

<p>And the newspapers next morning gayly chronicled
the elopement.</p>

<p>Viola herself had written the newspaper article,
smiling vindictively at the cruel stabs it held for Philip
Desha’s heart.</p>

<p>Then she handed the sheet to her new-made husband,
and he began to read it, exclaiming, admiringly:</p>

<p>“Capital, Viola! This will hoodwink everybody,
and cover Desha with confusion.”</p>

<p>“That is what I most desire!” she replied, bitterly;
and he saw that her complete revenge absorbed all
her thoughts.</p>

<p>He read on, and at the last words he started in surprise,
and whispered, hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Viola, this latter clause? I did not know about
that! I—I—shall be accused of being a fortune-hunter!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; for the fact of my being my mother’s
sole heiress was not generally known. In fact, papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
has never told me of it, but Aunt Edwina mentioned it
one day,” replied Viola, rising, and standing by his
side, a pale, excited bride, with a strange fire burning
in her splendid eyes.</p>

<p>They were alone where kindly Doctor Meade had
left them to do their writing, and Maxwell looked
wistfully at the beautiful, pallid face, longing to repeat
the kiss he had dared to press on her lips at the close
of their strange marriage vows.</p>

<p>But he remembered how cold and unresponsive they
had been, and saw no invitation in her eyes now, so
he stifled the longing, and said, quietly:</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me a moment, I will arrange
with Doctor Meade for sending off this notice to the
newspapers, and see if the cab I ordered has arrived.”</p>

<p>He hurried out, and the pale bride stood alone amid
the ruin of her hopes and in the pride of her revenge.</p>

<p>She could think of nothing but of how cleverly she
had turned the tables on Philip Desha and Florian
Gay.</p>

<p>“They will be mystified by the suddenness of my
marriage, and perhaps believe it was premeditated,
after all,” she thought, hopefully. “What a clever
man Mr. Maxwell is to have thought of this way of
checkmating them. I shall always be very grateful to
him, both for preventing my rash attempt at suicide
and for helping me to my revenge.”</p>

<p>And it did not occur to her half-distraught mind
then that a husband had a claim to more than gratitude
at her hands.</p>

<p>“Our cab is ready. We will go home now,” he
said, returning, and leading her out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The cab rolled lightly over the smooth streets, and
Viola began to realize all at once the change that was
coming into her own life; but she did not repent her
rash marriage. In her bitter mood she would have
sacrificed her own life rather than have foregone to-morrow’s
triumph.</p>

<p>They were quite silent for a few minutes; then her
husband said, kindly:</p>

<p>“Of course you realize, Viola, that the home to
which you are going is very different from the luxurious
one you have left? We live in a tiny cottage on
Capitol Hill, and my invalid mother and my orphan
cousin, little Mae Sweetland, are dependent on me for
support. But my mother will soon have a pension.
My father was a soldier, a captain in the Federal
Army, though while we had a modest competence,
mother never wished for a pension, but the failure of
a bank left us penniless, and I had to leave West
Point, where I was being educated, to come home
and take up journalistic work to support our helpless
family. But mother will receive her pension soon,
with back pay, so that our home will be more comfortable
then, and I can go away to Cuba with an
easy mind.”</p>

<p>Viola had listened attentively, and now she answered:</p>

<p>“And I shall have my own fortune, too, so I shall
not lack for the luxury to which I have been used.”</p>

<p>“Not a word against my going to Cuba,” thought
the handsome young husband, with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>But he could not blame her in the least. She had
not professed any regard for him; she had only accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
him in preference to the other alternative—George
Merrington—“silly, lovesick boy,” as she had
contemptuously termed him.</p>

<p>Besides, he had told her frankly that he would go
to Cuba after their marriage. Perhaps that fact had
turned the balance in his favor and made her accept
his offer.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” he said, cheerfully, as the cab
stopped before a little white cottage inclosed in a
grassy plot. “It is eleven o’clock, yet I see a light in
the parlor window. They are waiting up for me, dear
mother and little Mae.”</p>

<p>He handed her out, drew her hand through his arm
with a fond, protecting air, and they walked up the
narrow graveled path together, the young man saying,
encouragingly:</p>

<p>“It will be a great surprise to them, my bringing
home a bride to-night; but they will love you for my
sake!”</p>

<p>Slipping his latch-key into the door, he opened it,
and led her into a small unlighted hall.</p>

<p>At the sound of their footsteps the parlor door
opened quickly, and in the sudden light that streamed
out, Viola saw a fair young girl standing smiling on
the threshold—a petite blonde, lovely as a doll, with a
glad light of welcome shining in her deep azure eyes.</p>

<p>“Rolfe!” she cried, joyously, before she perceived
Viola.</p>

<p>But the next moment a startled look came over
her face, and crying, “Oh!” in a voice of dismay, she
darted back to a sofa where a handsome, dark-eyed
woman lay resting with the weariness of an invalid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>To this lady Rolfe Maxwell led his pale bride, saying,
smilingly:</p>

<p>“Mother, don’t get excited, please, but I have a
great surprise for you and Mae. I was quietly married
at Doctor Meade’s tonight, and this is my bride,
Viola!”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s painful, embarrassing pause,
and no wonder, because the shock of surprise had
certainly been great, but it was broken by a startling
incident.</p>

<p>“Married! Married! Oh, Heaven!” almost
shrieked Mae Sweetland, despairingly, as she threw up
her arms in the air, then sank unconscious to the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maxwell raised herself on her elbow and
looked at the fallen girl with her lovely face and closed
eyes upturned to the light. In her alarm she did not
heed Viola’s presence.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rolfe, what have you done?” she groaned,
wildly. “You have broken dear little Mae’s heart!”</p>

<p>“Mother!” in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“You have broken Mae’s heart!” she repeated,
angrily. “She loved you dearly. She thought you
loved her in return, and would marry her when your
fortune mended, and I—as blind as she was—I encouraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
her to think so. And now this terrible
blow!”</p>

<p>It was a strange welcome for the young bride. She
stared with dazed eyes at the prostrate girl, while her
ears drank in every word of Rolfe’s mother.</p>

<p>As for him, he grew pale with indignation as he
pressed Viola’s hand against his arm, replying:</p>

<p>“Mother, before Heaven I never dreamed of such
fancies on your part, or Mae’s, whom I loved as a dear
little sister only, and I am sorry I have unwittingly
given her pain. But you have done wrong to betray
my cousin’s tender secret to me and to my wife.”</p>

<p>The invalid turned her sorrowful dark eyes quickly
on Viola, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for my indiscreet speech, dear,
and for forgetting to welcome you in my fright over
Mae. I am sure I shall love Rolfe’s wife dearly.”</p>

<p>And she held out her hand; but the one that Viola
placed in it was cold as ice, as she answered, proudly:</p>

<p>“I am sorry I have disappointed your wishes for
your son, madame.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rolfe stooped over Mae, and lifting her
gently in his arms, said:</p>

<p>“Mother, I had better carry her to her room, so that
you can attend to her, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, following him weakly, then
sending him out, saying, bitterly: “Go back to your
haughty bride. I can manage Mae best alone.”</p>

<p>He returned to Viola, most bitterly pained and chagrined
by this awkward <i>contretemps</i>.</p>

<p>She had thrown herself into an easy-chair, her burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
eyes fixed on the floor, and her face a marble mask
in its deep pallor.</p>

<p>If she had loved him he would have clasped her to
his heart, telling her of his deep devotion and begging
her to forget what had happened just now.</p>

<p>But he fancied she would not have tolerated that,
so he drew a chair to her side, and venturing to touch
one of her cold hands caressingly, said, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Viola, I hope you will forget the scene of just now.
It was most embarrassing for us both, but my mother,
who has been an invalid several months, was overcome
by surprise and excitement. She and Mae have been
very silly in their fancies, for I never thought of the
dear child only as a cousin or sister. I have been in
love with you long before you ever saw me or heard
my name, though you would never have known it but
for the happenings of tonight.”</p>

<p>Viola started, glanced keenly at him, then dropped
her eyes again without a word, and he did not dream
how he had eased her heart with those simple words:
“I have been in love with you long before you ever
saw me or heard my name.”</p>

<p>“How strange! I wonder where he first saw me,”
she mused, for but a moment ago her heart had been
racked by the fear that he shared little Mae’s pain of
hopeless love—that she had come between them by
almost asking him to marry her outright to save her
from tomorrow’s keen humiliation.</p>

<p>To have added this blunder to her other trials must
have driven poor Viola nearer insanity than she was
already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell continued in his deep, musical tone
that had in it the soothing note we use to a hurt child:</p>

<p>“When you know mother better, you will find that
she is incapable of knowingly giving pain. She will
prepare our little spare room for you presently, for I
am sure you are weary and would like to be alone. In
the meantime, let me take your hat and jacket away,
and then I will brew you some tea. Would you not
like it?”</p>

<p>Viola assented wearily, and he waited on her with
the tenderness of a lover and the skill of a woman.</p>

<p>The bright, warm little parlor seemed very cozy
after her adventures that cold March night, and she
actually swallowed the fragrant tea Rolfe put to her
lips, though she had fancied she would choke in the
effort.</p>

<p>“How comforting he is!” she thought mechanically
through the haze of her wretched thoughts, that wandered
hither and thither, but mostly toward home,
wondering what they would say there when they found
her gone in the morning.</p>

<p>She had locked her room-door and put the key in
her pocket on leaving, lest the inquisitive ladys’-maid
should find out her flitting; so she knew her absence
would not be known till morning—perhaps not even
until at breakfast, when her father opened his morning
paper.</p>

<p>Suddenly she burst into a passion of grieving tears,
breaking up all the stony calm she had preserved since
the marriage.</p>

<p>With a cry of dismay, Rolfe Maxwell knelt by her
side, daring to draw the dark head tenderly against his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
breast, and Viola did not resent it; to his great relief,
she simply nestled there like a grieving child, while the
tears rained down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“What is it, my dearest love, my darling?” he whispered,
anxiously.</p>

<p>She moaned piteously:</p>

<p>“I was thinking of—of—poor papa. He will not
know I am gone till he opens his paper at breakfast
in the morning—and—and—it will break his heart!”</p>

<p>“What would you wish me to do for you, dear love?
Go to him or write to him? I will do anything you
wish,” he promised, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Do nothing yet—he will be too angry to listen. We
must wait till his wrath blows over,” she panted in
dread, drawing her face away and resting it against
the soft cushion of her chair.</p>

<p>In another moment the strange, narcotic influence
of grief overpowered the unhappy girl, and she slept
like a child, losing for a time the memory of her sorrows.</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell gazed on her a few minutes with his
passionate heart in his eyes, then pressed his lips softly
on the rich waves of her perfumed dark hair ere he
turned away to see that the little spare room was made
comfortable for her to occupy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, his mother’s efforts had, after a
time, restored his unhappy cousin to consciousness.</p>

<p>The girl lay still and dazed for some moments, then,
as memory returned, she sobbed, miserably:</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Margaret, is it really true? Has Rolfe
married that proud girl who looked like a queen?”</p>

<p>“It is true, dear, and I am very sorry; but we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
make the best of it; only I wish he had not taken us
by surprise!” sighed Mrs. Maxwell.</p>

<p>“I hate her! I wish I could part them, even now!”
declared Mae, her sweet young face flushing with
baleful anger.</p>

<p>“Dear Mae, you must not feel like that. Rolfe loves
his beautiful young bride, and it is our duty to love
her too,” the lady said, gently.</p>

<p>Mae sat up in bed, her azure eyes flashing with
an anger her aunt had never suspected in her before.
She sobbed, bitterly:</p>

<p>“I will not love her, the proud, beautiful creature
who has stolen Rolfe’s heart from me so cruelly, and
broken mine!”</p>

<p>“Dear Mae, we were mistaken in our hopes of
Rolfe. He only loved you as a little sister, while we
dreamed of something nearer and dearer. I am to
blame for fostering such hopes in you. Will you forgive
me, dear, and try to be happy without Rolfe?”
pleaded Rolfe’s mother.</p>

<p>“I can not be happy without him. I have loved him
more than a year, and all my hopes centered on him.
That proud beauty can never love him as dearly as I
love him!” sobbed Mae, casting pride to the winds
in the shock of her grief, and refusing all pacification
as she cast herself, weeping, back among her pillows,
so that the perturbed aunt had perforce to excuse herself
presently and go away to look after the comfort
of her unwelcome guest.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">His warmth to stamp the marriage seal,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Maxwell and Rolfe soon had the tiny spare
room bright and cozy for Viola, and while the young
girl still slept on wearily in the parlor, he made a bungling
explanation of his marriage.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to shock you, mother, but this was
a rather sudden move on my part. The truth is, that
I carried Viola off from another man that she expected
to wed tomorrow, and her father will be very angry,
of course; but the sensation will soon blow over.
Very unfortunately, I am obliged to go to New York
on business tonight, and must leave my bride in your
care.”</p>

<p>She thought it would look very strange leaving his
young bride on his wedding-night, and she said so
frankly.</p>

<p>The hot color surged up to the roots of the clustering
black curls on his brow, then receded, leaving him
deathly pale again, as he answered, quickly:</p>

<p>“Viola will understand the necessity. Besides, I
will leave a little note that will explain. I will soon be
back—probably tomorrow evening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>He took her hand, and said, earnestly:</p>

<p>“Dear mother, you have always been good to your
boy, but I see that I have strained your love tonight.
Will you try to forgive me for disappointing your
wishes about Mae, and be kind to my precious Viola?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will, Rolfe,” she answered.</p>

<p>But he persevered:</p>

<p>“She will need more than kindness—she will need
real motherly tenderness and sympathy, for she is
nervous and troubled over the shock she has given her
father, and is likely to be very unhappy for some
time. You will know how to comfort her, will you
not, dear mother?”</p>

<p>His voice was so eager and anxious that she answered
yes, promising her heart to do her duty by
Rolfe’s wife, in spite of her secret resentment for poor
Mae’s sake.</p>

<p>When he had left the house she returned to the
parlor, and found Viola still sleeping so soundly that
she had not the heart to rouse her yet. She drew up
a chair and waited awhile, gazing admiringly at the
beautiful creature.</p>

<p>Presently Viola stirred restlessly, sighed, and opened
her large dreamy eyes upon the unfamiliar scene, and
the strange face of her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she uttered, in a dazed voice, sitting quickly
erect.</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed, my dear, you have fallen
asleep in your chair and been dreaming. You are here
in Rolfe’s home safe with his mother,” said the lady,
gently.</p>

<p>A gleam of comprehension flashed into Viola’s eyes,
and she sighed heavily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“I remember—everything.”</p>

<p>“I have a bit of sad news for you, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” inquiringly.</p>

<p>The answer was a sealed letter.</p>

<p>Viola took it in surprise, and opened it, reading with
dilated eyes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Precious Wife</span>,—I mentioned to you tonight
that I had an offer to go to Cuba as a war correspondent
for a newspaper, and I find it almost necessary to
go to New York tonight to make the requisite arrangements
for immediate departure.</p>

<p>“This happens very fortunately for you under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>“You will not be compelled to assume as yet the
duties of a wifehood that would be repugnant to you
now, though I hope at some future day to teach your
heart the sweet lesson of love. Am I presumptuous?</p>

<p>“We must keep up the farce of love—no farce on
my part—to blind the world, and make it believe in the
honesty of the <i>coup d’état</i> by which you came out of
the affair with Desha with flying colors. Do not lay
aside for a moment the pretense that the force of love
alone caused your elopement.</p>

<p>“Above all, spare my gentle mother any knowledge
of the real truth. It will not take much acting to
please her gentle heart with the fancy that I am dear
to you. May the fancy some day become reality.</p>

<p>“I have dared kiss you good-bye as you slept. I
hope you will rest easy till my return tomorrow evening.
I will give orders for the morning papers to be
sent you.</p>

<p class="sigprefix">“Devotedly,</p>
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Rolfe</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Viola read the short letter slowly and lingeringly,
and then thrust it into her bosom.</p>

<p>The woman who watched her saw her lips quiver,
and said, tenderly:</p>

<p>“I told Rolfe it was hard for him to go tonight, but
he seemed to think you would not blame him, dear.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I understand,” the girl answered, quietly;
then suddenly hid her pale face in her hands, while a
burning crimson flushed up to her brow at the deceit
she must practice on the kind soul who thought she
was grieving because of Rolfe’s absence, while instead
she was unutterably grateful to him for his chivalrous
consideration.</p>

<p>Until this moment Viola had been so absorbed in her
revenge that she had scarcely given a thought to the
man she had married.</p>

<p>Yet he, gently and unobtrusively, had considered
everything, planned everything, that her treasured
vengeance need not go awry, while at the same time
she need not pay too dear a price for the victory. Loving
her with all the strong passion of manhood, he
would not force his love on her sore heart. He
would be patient and bide his time, though not concealing
the tenderness of his hope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maxwell, full of the thought of comforting
her, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear, how soundly you slept! It is wonderful
that Rolfe did not wake you while he knelt by
you, kissing your face, your hands, and your hair in
good-bye. He said: ‘Mother, is she not beautiful—the
most beautiful girl in the world? I can not tell you
how fondly I love her. Ever since the first day I saw
her she has been growing into my heart, taking such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
deep root there that I shall love her forever!’” She
stopped, for Viola’s stony calm had suddenly broken
up in a storm of sobs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maxwell thought, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Poor dear, how she loves him, and what a grief
it is that he had to leave her tonight! Well, well, I
must coax her to bed, so that I can go back and reason
with dear Mae, for I encouraged her in her love
for my son, and now I must help her to throw off its
chains!”</p>

<p>“Viola is taking a protracted beauty-sleep this
morning,” observed Mrs. Herman at breakfast, next
day, seeing her brother glance impatiently at his
daughter’s empty chair. Judge Van Lew, who was a
stickler for punctuality at meals, immediately sent a
servant to call Viola, and the meal proceeded in
silence.</p>

<p>Presently the neat maid Eliza came tripping in
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Miss Viola’s door has been locked ever since ten
o’clock last night, and she is not up yet,” she said.</p>

<p>“Go and knock upon the door,” said Mrs. Herman.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am, I’ve knocked time and again this morning,
but she does not answer me. It’s strange for
Miss Viola to sleep so late, and—and—I’m almost
frightened!” the girl whimpered in alarm.</p>

<p>“Go and knock again very loudly, and if she does
not respond, I will go myself,” Judge Van Lew said,
sternly.</p>

<p>He pushed back his plate and began to glance over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
the morning papers while the placid Mrs. Herman
sipped her coffee.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a strange choking sound, and
glanced up in alarm to see her brother lying back in
his chair, his face purple, his breath coming in excited
gasps.</p>

<p>She jumped up and hurried to his side, gasping:</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it, Edmund? Are you ill?” foreboding
an apoplectic seizure.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew struggled for speech, then blurted
out, thickly:</p>

<p>“Read!”</p>

<p>Then she saw that he still clutched the newspaper
in his hand, and snatching it wildly, she saw what had
shocked him so—the sensational announcement of
Viola’s elopement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Herman dropped heavily into a chair, almost
fainting with the shock, and just then Eliza returned.</p>

<p>“I have knocked and knocked—and rattled and
pounded—but she does not hear me! I’m afraid she
must be dead, sir!” she exclaimed, fearfully.</p>

<p>The stricken man held up his hand, and muttered,
harshly:</p>

<p>“Go!”</p>

<p>She retreated in alarm, leaving the door wide open
in her dismay, and the next moment her voice echoed
back to them from the hall in tones of glad surprise:</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Viola, so you went out for an early walk,
did you? Well, that is a splendid way to brighten
your color for the wedding! But why did you lock
the door? You have given us all such a fright!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Viola pushed past her without a word, and hurried
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>When she saw the two elderly people in the shocking
state caused by the news of her elopement, it made
her heart ache with tenderness and pity.</p>

<p>She rushed to them, crying wildly, imploringly:</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!—oh, auntie! don’t look so wretched,
please! I want you both to forgive me!”</p>

<p>She flung her arms about her father and covered
his purple, distorted face with piteous kisses, the tears
raining from her eyes.</p>

<p>“Papa, darling, won’t you forgive your naughty
Viola?”</p>

<p>For answer he pushed her violently from him with
all the strength he could exert in his weakened state.</p>

<p>She caught the back of a chair, or she must have
fallen.</p>

<p>“Papa!” she gasped, reproachfully.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew staggered up to his feet, his anger
helping him to get the better of his weakness.</p>

<p>He thundered, angrily:</p>

<p>“How dare you darken my doors again, you wicked
girl, after what you have done?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Herman clutched his arm imploringly, but
he shook her off in a rage, repeating:</p>

<p>“How dared you return, I say?”</p>

<p>“To—to—beg you to forgive me, papa,” faltered
the pallid bride, fearfully.</p>

<p>“Forgive you—never! You have broken a good
man’s heart by your accursed fickleness, and disgraced
me forever, and I will disown and disinherit you, leaving
you nothing but an outraged father’s curse on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
death-bed!” stormed Judge Van Lew, in a fury that
was dangerous to his life, so purple grew his face,
while the knotted veins stood out like whip-cords on
his brow.</p>

<p>Viola’s own quick temper blazed up at his charges,
her pale cheeks flamed, and the tears dried up in her
eyes as she answered, spiritedly:</p>

<p>“I came to ask you to forgive me, papa, not to
listen to abuse! But since you refuse to pardon me,
and threaten me with disinheritance, I can be as proud
as you are! I suppose I can live without your forgiveness
and without your money, too, since my dead
mother’s fortune comes to me on my marriage!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! does it indeed? So that is what made
that fortune-hunting wretch so bold in stealing you
from Philip Desha—the hope of handling your rich
inheritance! But how chagrined he will be on learning
that your mother made the condition that unless you
married with my approval the money should revert to
me! And I assure you that you will never receive one
penny to reward you for your treachery. And as for
the villain you have married—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Aunt Edwina muttered, shaking his arm,
rebukingly.</p>

<p>Viola, as white as a sheet, her eyes dim and glazing,
turned toward the door; but her aunt called out, pityingly:</p>

<p>“Viola, my dear, see, there is a letter on your plate
waiting for you. They say it came at daylight this
morning, but your door was locked, and you could not
be aroused.”</p>

<p>The girl caught up the large, square white envelope,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
tore it open mechanically, and ran her heavy eyes over
its contents.</p>

<p>Then the two who watched her heard a loud shriek
of dismay. Viola tottered and fell unconscious to the
floor.</p>

<p>Her father darted forward, seized the letter, and
quickly mastered its contents.</p>

<p>“This explains something of the mystery!” he cried,
thrusting it into Mrs. Herman’s hand, and adding,
furiously:</p>

<p>“Viola shall never return to that villain, Rolfe Maxwell—never!
never! unless it be over my dead body!
I will keep her locked up in this house until she consents
to apply for a divorce, do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Edmund!” she whimpered; but she saw that it
would be quite useless to plead with the enraged father.</p>

<p>The senseless form of Viola was borne tenderly to
her room, and her aunt and maid vied with each other
in their efforts to restore her to her saddened life.</p>

<p>Viola struggled back to consciousness again, and her
first words were to ask for the letter that had affected
her so terribly.</p>

<p>“Your father took it, dear child,” was the gentle
reply.</p>

<p>“He must not read it, not one word of it! Go and
tell him to send it to me, Eliza!” the poor girl cried,
frantically.</p>

<p>The maid went away obediently, but failed to return,
the judge himself coming instead, looking at his daughter
in wonder, she was so pale, so changed from the
radiant girl of yesterday.</p>

<p>He sat down by the side of the bed, and she cried,
eagerly:</p>

<p>“My letter, papa, my letter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>He answered, sternly:</p>

<p>“I have read every word of it, Viola.”</p>

<p>The color flushed her pale cheeks like a rose.</p>

<p>“How dared you? You had no right!”</p>

<p>“I took the right, and I am glad that I did, for now
I have an inkling of what led to your elopement last
night. Now, Viola, you must tell me the whole miserable
story.”</p>

<p>She felt as if she was withering under his searching
gaze as he demanded the truth.</p>

<p>Oh, how could she confess the keen humiliation she
had risked so much to hide from the world? Why had
that wretched letter ever come?</p>

<p>But Judge Van Lew, in his wrath, was merciless to
the willful daughter that until today he had fairly
idolized.</p>

<p>No criminal at the bar of justice was ever put
through a more searching cross-examination by the
lawyer than now fell to the portion of unhappy Viola.</p>

<p>And before she fairly realized what she had done,
she was goaded into confessing everything to her
father and her aunt.</p>

<p>Then she faltered:</p>

<p>“You can not be angry with me now, papa, since
you know all the bitter truth!”</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh! you made too much of a lovers’ quarrel,
Viola. If you had only waited till this morning,
how happy you would have been now!”</p>

<p>The great gray eyes flashed proudly.</p>

<p>“Do you think I could have forgiven him for last
night—if he had sent a thousand letters?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you would. The poor fellow acted upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
impulse last night, and you must admit he had great
provocation, too; but he made amends this morning.
You have been terribly punished, Viola, for your willful
coquetries.”</p>

<p>“I must go now,” she answered, rising quickly.</p>

<p>“Viola, you are never going back to your unloved
husband. I must save you from the consequences of
your mad mistake.”</p>

<p>“Papa!” wildly.</p>

<p>“I repeat it. You shall never go back to him again.
You shall remain here under my charge. I shall
speedily procure a divorce for you from this presuming
fellow who took advantage of your trouble to betray
you into such bonds. Not a word—you have owned
you did not love him—leave the rest to me. Why,
Edwina, the silly girl is fainting again! I will leave
you to bring her to reason, for my word is law!” and
he stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>That evening, as he sat alone in his library, a card
was brought him, and he said, curtly:</p>

<p>“Show Mr. Maxwell in here.”</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell entered, pale but composed, fully anticipating
an ordeal of a crucial nature.</p>

<p>“Ah, good-evening, Mr. Maxwell. You have called,
I presume, to receive payment for the work you did for
me?” sneeringly.</p>

<p>“No, judge, not at present. I came to see my wife.
She is here?” anxiously.</p>

<p>“My daughter Viola is here,” curtly.</p>

<p>“And of course you are aware that she was married
to me last evening, sir? So I hope she will grant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
me a short interview,” Rolfe Maxwell humbly said in
his great love.</p>

<p>But the judge replied, mercilessly:</p>

<p>“She declines to see you, sir, now or ever.”</p>

<p>“But what have I done?”</p>

<p>“Read that letter, and see what an accursed thing
you have done in sundering two fond hearts!” thundered
the irate father, thrusting a letter into his hand.</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell flushed proudly at Judge Van Lew’s
overbearing manner, but he took the offered letter in
silence, and perused it with eager eyes.</p>

<p>And the angry father, watching him closely, saw the
proud lips under the dark, silken mustache whiten to a
bluish pallor, and the light of the flashing eyes grow
dim, while the hand that handed back the fatal letter
trembled as with an ague chill.</p>

<p>There was a brief, chilling silence, broken at last by
the judge:</p>

<p>“Viola came home to me this morning, Mr. Maxwell,
and confessed everything that happened last night; the
reception of this letter from Mr. Desha, avowing his
repentance and begging that the marriage should go on
today, nearly broke the poor girl’s heart.”</p>

<p>Rolfe Maxwell looked at the speaker, asking, abruptly:</p>

<p>“And she would have forgiven him—taken him
back?”</p>

<p>“Can you doubt it? She made too much of a lovers’
quarrel in the first place, and she ought to have known
he would repent before today, as he did, for his letter
was sent at the first peep of dawn. Now you can realize
what your officious intermeddling has done!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>The young man could not refrain from answering,
bitterly:</p>

<p>“Then you call it officious intermeddling to have
saved your daughter from the violent death she sought
in her frantic despair of life?”</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew bit his lip, and flushed at the slight
reminder, answering:</p>

<p>“No; we both owe you a debt of gratitude for that
brave deed, and we should owe you more if you had
persuaded Viola to come home and be reasonable, instead
of luring her into that unsuitable marriage.”</p>

<p>“Did your daughter accuse me of luring her into
that marriage?”</p>

<p>The words dropped coldly from the young man’s
lips, and the judge fidgeted under his anxious scrutiny
as he retorted:</p>

<p>“I am using my own words, not Viola’s; but still I
am keeping to the letter of what she told me. Of
course she is bitterly sorry now that she is bound to
you, and you must realize that yourself.”</p>

<p>Yes, Rolfe Maxwell realized it with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>In his love and his sympathy he had eagerly lent
himself to her frantic plans for staving off the humiliation
of tomorrow, and this was the way it had all
ended—in regret and despair for Viola, remorse and
pain for himself.</p>

<p>Speech failed him. He could only stare mutely at
his accuser, taking to himself all the blame of last
night, shielding Viola by his silence.</p>

<p>He had been eager to lay his heart at her feet, he
knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>But she had just as eagerly accepted it, and thanked
him for the offer.</p>

<p>“It is not for me to tell her father the truth. The
blame be mine,” he thought, loyal to his love.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew continued, harshly:</p>

<p>“I do not wish to censure your action too severely,
for I remember, while I blame you for that marriage,
that you saved her life. Yet I am obliged to tell you
that those bonds must be broken.”</p>

<p>“You are not willing to accept me as a son-in-law?”
quietly.</p>

<p>“No—nor Viola—as a husband!”</p>

<p>Crisp, and clear, and cold, with an accent of contempt,
the words fell, and Rolfe Maxwell started as if
the point of a sword had been pressed against his heart.
Then he said, huskily:</p>

<p>“Viola wished you to tell me this?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has left everything to me. I shall take
speedy steps to have the marriage annulled and set her
free.”</p>

<p>“To marry Desha?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“She wishes it?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall offer no opposition to her desires,”
proudly. “Indeed, I came here this evening to tell her
that unless she wished me to stay, I leave tomorrow for
Cuba as a war correspondent.”</p>

<p>“A clever idea. It will simplify matters. I thank
you in Viola’s name for giving up your slight claim
so easily.”</p>

<p>“Slight claim, sir? She is my wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Pshaw!” angrily.</p>

<p>“Therefore, her happiness is dearer to me than my
own; and I will make any sacrifice for her sake,” added
the handsome young fellow, in a broken voice, as he
rose and stood at the back of his chair, looking down
from the superb height of his magnificent manly beauty
on the unscrupulous man who was deceiving him so
cruelly.</p>

<p>“It is very good of you,” the judge said stiffly, feeling
ill at ease with himself at the part he was playing,
but thankful that the young husband could be imposed
on easily.</p>

<p>But the next moment Rolfe startled him by saying,
pleadingly, casting pride aside in the anguish of his
love:</p>

<p>“Will you not permit me a few moments with Viola
to bid her good-bye? Remember, it is a dangerous post
to which I go. A war correspondent’s life is in hourly
peril if he goes to the front as I am going. Viola may
be a widow before she secures her divorce.”</p>

<p>The deep, musical voice quivered with the weight
of his broken hopes and scorned love, but the judge
was pitiless.</p>

<p>“It is impossible for you to see her. She would not
be willing,” he said.</p>

<p>“You are sure—quite sure?”</p>

<p>“If I can believe her word!”</p>

<p>“Then she must be heartless indeed!” Rolfe burst
out, indignantly, his great eyes flashing on the proud
man, as he added: “May God forgive her for denying
me the only boon I prayed for—a last word, one last
look!” and he rushed from the luxurious room out into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the bleak March night that seemed to him no colder
than the heart of her on whom he had poured out the
costly libation of a true heart’s love in vain.</p>

<p>One bitter task remained to him, to go home to his
tender mother and confess the blighting truth that
Viola had repented her hasty marriage and returned to
her father’s house to seek his protection while she secured
the annulment of her fetters, and to prepare her
for his own departure on the morrow. This accomplished,
there remained nothing more in life but grim
duty. His noble heart, like many others, had been
sacrificed on the altar of a fair coquette’s capricious
fancy.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew sat long where Rolfe Maxwell had
left him smoking and trying to put down an uneasy
conscience.</p>

<p>He knew that he had carried things with a high hand
against the young man who had really behaved very
nobly toward Viola, and merited better than a summary
dismissal.</p>

<p>But he believed that he was acting in the best faith
toward Viola, for it did not occur to him that Rolfe
had any chance of winning her love.</p>

<p>Her fainting spell on reading Desha’s letter of repentance
had convinced him that she still loved the man
who wrote it. He felt that the greatest kindness he
could do his willful daughter was to help her undo the
fetters she had forged in her momentary madness of
despair.</p>

<p>So he had steeled his heart to Rolfe Maxwell and
sent him away by the utterance of falsehoods, against
which his own native manliness revolted, but which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
he justified to himself because he considered them
necessary for Viola’s sake.</p>

<p>But in his uncertainty of the girl’s real sentiments
he did not think it necessary to inform her at all of
the young man’s visit. Carrying his authority with
a high hand, he kept her locked in her own room till
the next afternoon, when she sent him an imperative
message.</p>

<p>He was shocked at the change in his beautiful
daughter since only yesterday, and he cried out in
alarm:</p>

<p>“Viola, are you ill?”</p>

<p>She answered, angrily:</p>

<p>“Ill of suspense and worry only. How dare you
keep me locked up in my room like this? I demand
to be released, that I may return to my husband!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“But, papa, I am in earnest. I must return to my
new home. What will my husband think of my remaining
away so long?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; because he has gone away himself to
Cuba, as he told you he would do.”</p>

<p>“Gone—gone! Without one farewell word to me,
his wife!” she almost shrieked.</p>

<p>“Come, Viola, no tragedies!” her father exclaimed,
sternly. “You never pretended to be in love with the
young fellow, you know, nor he with you. Your marriage
was a mistake, and I am going to free you from
it as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Papa!” wildly.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you I have seen Maxwell just
before he started for Cuba,” continued the judge. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
showed him Desha’s letter, and told him that you
fainted when you read it. He agreed with me that
he did wrong to marry you, and promised that he
would throw no obstacles in the way of your getting
a divorce!”</p>

<p>She answered, passionately:</p>

<p>“I tell you I do not want a divorce. I love him,
and I will remain his true, faithful wife till he comes
back to me!”</p>

</div>


<p>Judge Van Lew, with all his threats and entreaties,
found it impossible to combat Viola’s resolution.</p>

<p>She refused point-blank to apply for a divorce from
Rolfe Maxwell.</p>

<p>“Papa, he was kind to me when I did not seem to
have a friend left on earth, when all my lovers had
turned against me!” she said, plaintively.</p>

<p>“You had me, Viola.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid of your just wrath, when you should
find out how I had played fast and loose with Philip
and Florian. The future looked as black as a stormy
night without a star. In the desperation of my
wounded love and pride, I went out to seek death
rather than face the cruel morrow. Do you remember,
papa, where I should be now had not Rolfe Maxwell’s
hand been outstretched to save me? You would be
standing over my coffin now, weeping over my mutilated
beauty, crying: ‘Alas! poor Viola!’”</p>

<p>Her voice broke in tears at the pathetic picture, poor
Viola, who had always loved life so dearly and thought
it so beautiful, though for one mad moment she had
been tempted to cast it away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Judge Van Lew would not give way to weakness.
He answered, gruffly:</p>

<p>“I am weeping over you now in my heart, Viola,
over the wreck you have made of your life.”</p>

<p>“Do not say so,” she answered, bravely. “It is not
so bad, papa. Is he not very handsome and clever?
And he has shown himself most noble. Why, if I
cast him off now I should be the most ungrateful girl
in the world!”</p>

<p>“Yon can be as grateful to him as you please, but
you need not give him your life as a sacrifice. I tell
you, Viola, I will not have this poor and obscure young
man for a son-in-law when you can have your pick of
the richest and most distinguished! You shall apply for
a divorce as soon as I can prepare the papers.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you that I will not, papa; so you had
just as well let me go back to my husband’s home and
wait for him there in peace!” his daughter cried, with
kindling cheeks.</p>

<p>“You are insane, Viola. I have permitted you to
have your own way till you are going mad with silly
caprices. But I will no longer humor your whims.
I tell you now, and I mean it, that you shall give up
Rolfe Maxwell or remain a prisoner in this house
until you come to your senses!” stormed the judge,
now thoroughly enraged at her stubbornness.</p>

<p>But Viola had a will of her own, too, and it flashed
into her eyes as she cried, bitterly:</p>

<p>“I defy your power!”</p>

<p>His answer was to stalk out of the room, banging
the door in wrath, and not forgetting to lock it after
him and deliver the key to the tearful Mrs. Herman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
who did not know what to do between her brother and
her niece, thus playing at cross purposes.</p>

<p>What the outcome of their feud might have been had
Viola remained well, none could tell, for kind Aunt
Edwina found the poor girl presently in a high fever,
her cheeks scarlet, her eyes glaring, while delirious
murmurs babbled over her parched lips.</p>

<p>A physician was hastily summoned, who declared
that Viola was in the first stages of brain fever.</p>

<p>The terrible excitement of the past two days had
culminated in illness of the most dangerous type.</p>

<p>The sensation caused in the social world by her
remarkable elopement gave place to the excitement
of her illness and the report that death was about to
claim her for its own.</p>

<p>It was so sad, people said, that her young husband,
who had parted from her the very night of the wedding
to go to Cuba, should be far from her side now
in her terrible extremity; but there were others who
did not mind saying that she was getting punishment
now for jilting Philip Desha, who went about with a
face like a dead man’s, in his cruel humiliation, and
was feared to be losing his mind.</p>

<p>As for Florian Gay, no one guessed what a part he
had played in the tragedy of Viola’s life. He kept his
own counsel and sought what diversion he could, soothing
his pain with the triumph of the revenge he had
taken on his false love.</p>

<p>Weeks came and went while Viola lay in her white-hung
chamber, battling with the dread disease that
threatened her life, and meanwhile stirring events took
place outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>As the bleak March days passed into the showers
and sunshine of fickle April, and the people of the
United States began to have their sympathies aroused
for poor Cuba, bleeding in the chains of Spanish
tyranny, news came from the beautiful island in the
sea that blanched the cheek and crushed the loving
heart of the poor mother waiting in her cottage home,
while her only son risked the dangers of invading the
insurgents’ lines in quest of reliable news for his paper
at home.</p>

<p>For about three weeks he had electrified his countrymen
by his thrilling accounts of the war and the true
state of affairs in Cuba. His pen-pictures and illustrations
were read and gazed upon with interest by
millions of eager eyes. From the position of an unknown
reporter he had leaped at a bound to fame. It
was as if he had thrown himself heart and soul into
his work, determined to find in its fascinating toil and
danger a balm for the pangs of despised love.</p>

<p>Suddenly his newspaper ceased to print anything
more from his pen, and directly it announced the
reason.</p>

<p>By order of the notorious General Weyler, commander
of the Spanish army, Rolfe Maxwell had been
seized and thrown into prison for the news he had been
sending to America. Accused as a spy, he had been
placed in the terrible prison, Morro Castle, when each
morning at day-break rang out the fatal shots that
told off the lives of hapless prisoners.</p>

<p>Swiftly following the news of Rolfe Maxwell’s arrest
his name appeared in the list of those who had
suffered death in Morro Castle for his sympathy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
Cuba, and his fearless recital of her cruel wrongs to
a sympathizing world. The heroic young correspondent
had been foully slain, and a nation mourned his
loss.</p>

<p>It was barely five weeks since he had been sent to
his doom by the relentless father of Viola, who shuddered
as he read the news, muttering:</p>

<p>“He spoke prophetically when he said Viola might
be a widow before she secured a divorce.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Maxwell would never forget to her dying day
how surprised she was that bright May afternoon when
the elegant Van Lew carriage, with its liveried coachman,
stopped before the cottage gate, while the footman
handed out a graceful figure in deep mourning,
who came slowly up the walk and knocked timidly on
the door.</p>

<p>As she gazed from the window, her heart swelled
with bitterness toward the beautiful girl who had been
so cruel to poor Rolfe. The memory was still fresh in
her mind of that night when her handsome boy had
taken her into his confidence and told her so sadly that
his bride’s father had persuaded her to forsake him.</p>

<p>“Do not think unkindly of her, dear mother. She
was so young and thoughtless, she scarcely knew her
own mind, I suppose, and her haughty father probably
bullied her into giving me up,” he said, touching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
truth nearer than he knew in his anxiety to shield
Viola from his mother’s natural resentment.</p>

<p>Then, despite her opposition to his plans, he had
gone away to Cuba, and she had read in the papers afterward
of the dangerous illness of Viola, but it did not
at all soften her heart that was aching in sympathy
with her son’s pain. Though she was one of the best
women in the world, she could not help thinking most
bitterly:</p>

<p>“It will be no great loss if she dies, the cruel coquette!”</p>

<p>Then came occasional letters from Rolfe, always
full of interest for her motherly heart, and she was
glad that he seemed to have forgotten in his absorbing
work the painful episode of his marriage, since he
never mentioned Viola’s name. She, on her part, preserved
the same silence in her replies, never alluding
to the fact that the young girl lay ill unto death of
brain fever.</p>

<p>“Time enough to tell him if she dies!” was her resentful
thought, while she wondered if he would grieve
much, for she knew he had given the fickle girl the
wealth of a wonderful love.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maxwell found Mae Sweetland very quiet and
apathetic in those days after Rolfe’s going away, and
she was very patient and tender with the poor girl.
She guessed that she was ashamed and repentant over
her violent self-betrayal the night Rolfe brought his
bride home, and that she was trying to tear from her
heart its hopeless dream of love.</p>

<p>“Ah, how much better for us all if he had loved
sweet Mae, instead of that proud, fickle beauty, Viola
Van Lew!” she thought, with unavailing regret.</p>

<p>Then came the journalistic triumphs of that beloved
son that made his name a household word, followed
so swiftly by the tragedy that left her childless and
alone in the world.</p>

<p>At first she could not believe that her darling was
dead. “There must be some mistake!” she cried, in
her terrible agony of bereavement.</p>

<p>Surely the newspapers would begin to deny the story
soon, for news from the seat of war was often unreliable.</p>

<p>And she did not give up looking for a letter from
Rolfe; but the postman on his daily rounds passed
the gate each day without a glance at the tearful face
glued to the window-pane, and the long days slipped
away, and there was no official contradiction of the
news of Rolfe’s death, while the newspapers daily filled
columns on the atrocities of his murderer. Then the
sensation yielded to another one; the bright spring days
advanced joyfully, as if there were no such things as
death and sorrow in the big, round world; the bare
trees put on garbings of tender, green leaves; the fragrant
hyacinths bloomed in the green plat before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
front door, the bereaved mother gave up hope, and
permitted Mae to choose for her some somber mourning
gowns.</p>

<p>Only that morning she had had such a start when the
postman opened the gate at last and came in; but it
was only a letter for Mae from some of her distant
relatives, inviting her for a visit down into the country.</p>

<p>“You must go, my dear. It will be such a pleasant
change for you from this sorrowful house,” her aunt
said.</p>

<p>“And leave you here all alone? That would be
cruel!” cried Mae, generously, though her heart had
secretly leaped at the thought of needed change of
scene.</p>

<p>“You shall go, darling, because you need a change
so much. Your rosy cheeks have grown pale, and your
bright eyes dim, with confinement and loneliness,” insisted
Mrs. Maxwell; and they were talking it over that
afternoon at the window together when the carriage
stopped in the street and the graceful form in heavy
black came in at the gate and up the narrow walk to
the door.</p>

<p>The poor mother caught her breath with a gasp of
pain as Mae exclaimed, bitterly:</p>

<p>“It is poor Rolfe’s widow! How strange that she
has put on mourning! Will you go to the door, aunt?
Or shall I?”</p>

<p>She would have wondered yet more at Viola’s wearing
black if she had known what opposition she had
had to encounter at home.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew and Aunt Edwina had both been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
dead set against it, but her strong will had carried the
day.</p>

<p>They had not dared oppose her too much, for Viola
had been so near the borders of the grave in her
month’s illness, and she was still so weak and nervous
they had delayed as long as possible the telling her of
Rolfe Maxwell’s death.</p>

<p>Only two weeks ago they had informed her as cautiously
as possible of the dreadful tragedy of his taking
off.</p>

<p>A long swoon had resulted, and they feared at first
a relapse into serious illness.</p>

<p>But in a day or two Viola rallied, though a new expression
had come into her face that startled them with
its somber, far-away look. She did not mention her
dead husband’s name, but she insisted on being fitted
out at once in widow’s mourning.</p>

<p>They entreated and expostulated, but Viola insisted
all the more resolutely, and in her weak, nervous state
it was dangerous to thwart her wishes, so she had her
way.</p>

<p>“After all, it may be better so,” Mrs. Herman said,
soothingly, to the perturbed judge. “Fortunately, the
young man died before you had begun the action for
divorce, so if Viola chooses to enact the part of a
bereaved young widow, it will excite less comment
than if she appeared indifferent and wore no black.”</p>

<p>So, because it seemed the easiest way to prevent
talk, Viola was permitted to take up the role of a grieving
young widow, though her father said, brusquely:</p>

<p>“Viola must be genuinely fond of a sensation, or
she would not be willing to carry out such a farce of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
mourning for a man she never pretended to love.”</p>

<p>“It is to punish Desha, perhaps,” returned Mrs.
Herman, who had been taken into the bitter secret of
Viola’s wedding-eve; and she added, thoughtfully:
“No one can tell just what is in Viola’s mind. She is
so strange since she heard the news of Maxwell’s
death. And really it would not have been hard to love
such a magnificent young man if her heart had not already
been engaged by Desha. I remember, when you
first sent him here, I tried to prevent an interview between
them, fearing a flirtation, she was so giddy.”</p>

<p>“I made a great mistake having him here at all,”
groaned the judge. “But it is too late to repent it now.
After all, he was a fine young fellow, and made himself
a splendid fame before he died. One need not be
ashamed of such a son-in-law.”</p>

<p>“No; and we must not be hard on poor Viola,” said
the gentle lady.</p>

<p>And as Viola never did things by halves, they were
not surprised when she said frankly one day:</p>

<p>“Papa, I think it is only right that I should make a
call on my mother-in-law. She will feel as if I did not
love Rolfe much if I neglect my duty to her now that
he is dead.”</p>

<p>“How superbly she carries out the farce,” he
thought; but he did not express his disapprobation of
her wish. He merely said, coldly and briefly: “Of
course you must do as you think best, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she faltered, sensitively, conscious of
his disapproval, but ordering the carriage just the same
for that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Shall you go to the door, aunt, or shall I?” repeated
Mae Sweetland, with a stifled heart-pang in her musical

in her train.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not wish to see her! I—I hate the sight

sent him to his death!” groaned the bereaved mother.</p>

<p>Another moment and the beautiful rivals stood face

night when they had so balefully crossed each other’s
lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Viola flung back the somber folds of crape, and her
face, pale and pure as carved pearl, framed in short
curls of the silken hair ruthlessly shorn in the cruel
fever, beamed on Mae with a plaintive smile as she
asked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember me? I have come to see you

<p>“How ill and changed she looks! Did she love Rolfe
after all?” thought Mae; but aloud she answered,
coldly: “Yes, I remember you, but we—that is, my
aunt—begs to be excused.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that she will not see me?” Viola
cried, apprehensively, the color flushing through her
pale, transparent face like light within a crystal globe.</p>

<p>“She will not see you, because you were cruel to our
poor Rolfe,” Mae returned, indignantly, her soft blue
eyes beginning to flash and glow.</p>

<p>Viola recoiled as if the angry girl had struck her a
blow, her face paling, great burning tears flashing into
her dark, somber eyes, her voice trembling as she faltered:</p>

<p>“Oh, she must not refuse me! I must see her, if
only once! I promised him, and I must keep my
word!”</p>

<p>Pushing Mae aside in her pretty, imperious fashion,
Viola glided into the hall and into the presence of the
sobbing woman drooping so forlornly in her arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Mother—mother!” she cried, kneeling down impetuously
by her side, winding her arms about the
mourner, and laying her weary head on her breast.</p>

<p>And Mae, coming in presently in a dazed fashion,
found them mingling their tears together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>She sat down helplessly a little apart, and began to
weep, in a pitiful, noiseless way. She could not help
it, her heart was so full with the thought of Rolfe,
slain so cruelly in the splendor of his youth.</p>

<p>Viola, when she could find her voice, sobbed, plaintively:</p>

<p>“Why are you so angry with me still? Have you
never forgiven me yet—you and Mae—because Rolfe
loved me and made me his bride?”</p>

<p>The mother checked her sobs and sighed in answer:</p>

<p>“We could have forgiven you anything except that
you did not love him in return, and were cruel to my
noble boy!”</p>

<p>“Cruel—cruel!” cried Viola, in passionate agitation.
“Who could be more cruel than Rolfe himself, going
away from me—his wife—into exile, peril, and danger—and
not even coming to bid me good-bye—never
writing me one word while I lay ill on the very borders
of death!”</p>

<p>They gazed at her in astonishment, the mature
woman and the fair young girl, who exclaimed, indignantly:</p>

<p>“Why should Rolfe write to you when you had cast
him off? When you refused to see him when he came
to your father’s house to bid you farewell? When you
sent him word by your father that you regretted the
marriage and should sue for a divorce?”</p>

<p>Viola dragged herself up from her knees and sank
uninvited into a chair, turning her pale, startled face
upon the resentful speaker, who continued, angrily:</p>

<p>“Why should you come here and force yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
upon us when we hate you for your cruelty to our poor
Rolfe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why?” echoed Mrs. Maxwell, dully.</p>

<p>Viola cried out in a strained voice:</p>

<p>“But you accuse me falsely! I did not refuse to see
Rolfe. I did not know he came that night to my
father’s house. I never sent him the cruel messages
you repeat, for I had no other thought than to be his
true and faithful wife whenever he claimed me, so help
me Heaven!”</p>

<p>They saw all in a minute how cruelly Rolfe had been
deceived and sent away with a broken heart.</p>

<p>Viola had not been false and fickle, as they believed,
but the victim of an angry father’s plot to separate
her from her husband—a plot that had succeeded all
too well.</p>

<p>Rolfe lay in his untimely grave, and as for her, they
read on her wasted features and in her despairing eyes
the story of a late remorse more bitter than death.</p>

<p>“I understand everything now,” she added, faintly.
“We were the victims of an angry father’s despotic
will. A prisoner in my own home, I never knew of
my husband’s call that night, nor of the cruel falsehoods
he was told. No wonder he never wrote to me.
Oh, God! how bitter to think he died believing me
ungrateful and untrue. Pray Heaven, he knows better
now!” and she buried her face in her hands, her slight
form shaking with emotion.</p>

<p>At that moving sight Mae’s gentle heart began to
melt with pity and forgiveness. She hesitated a moment,
then rushed to Viola’s side and clasped her white
arms around her neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“We have wronged you—forgive us!” she cried, impulsively;
and they clasped each other and wept together,
jealous rivals no longer, but loving friends.</p>

<p>“Mother, I knew something must be wrong, or you
would have come to see me while I lay ill so long. I
suspected papa, because he had been so angry over my
marriage, so I decided to come and see you. And, oh,
how glad I am that I would not take Mae’s dismissal,
but forced my way to your presence! Will it not be
some comfort to you to know that I was true to
Rolfe?” Viola said, presently, thinking—oh, so tenderly!—of
Rolfe’s plaintive letter, in which he had
begged her to keep up a little pretense of caring for
him, just for his mother’s sake, that she might be less
unhappy when he was gone.</p>

<p>In his humility he had not guessed that Viola would
not need to pretend, since unconscious love had already
taken deep root in her grateful heart.</p>

<p>Yes, it made Mrs. Maxwell much happier to understand
that Viola had really cared for Rolfe. She did
not deny it, and her heart warmed to the sorrowful
young widow.</p>

<p>“We must always be dear friends now. Will you
both come and see me sometimes?” said Viola.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Maxwell’s face hardened as she answered:</p>

<p>“We could not come under the roof of the man who
wronged Rolfe and sent him away so unhappy to his
untimely death, dear Viola. Why, only think, my
daughter; if he had permitted your husband an interview
with you that night, you two might have come to
an understanding, and he might never have gone away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
I hope I am a good Christian, but I am not able to forgive
your father yet for his sin.”</p>

<p>Viola could not blame her for her bitterness, since
her own heart was hot with anger against the author
of her woe.</p>

<p>“You are right; but I shall come and see you often,
and you shall tell me stories of Rolfe. I shall want
to hear all about him from his very babyhood,” she
said, earnestly; adding, with a sudden blush: “And
I wish above all things for a good picture of him. Can
you give me one?”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” was the answer; and an album was
brought out containing pictures of Rolfe from infancy
to manhood.</p>

<p>Amid raining tears Viola made a selection, then rose
to go, begging Mae to accompany her for a short drive.</p>

<p>The young girl hesitated, then looked inquiringly at
her aunt.</p>

<p>“Go, dear; it will do you good,” Mrs. Maxwell answered,
encouragingly, for Viola’s fascination had
already fallen over both. She was queen of hearts
still, in all her woe.</p>

<p>Mae hurried to her chamber, and quickly returned in
a dark-blue gown wondrously becoming to her delicate
blonde beauty and the rich sheen of her golden hair
under the nodding black plumes of her hat.</p>

<p>“How lovely you are, sweet cousin!” cried Viola,
wondering how Rolfe’s heart had been proof against
such beauty and sweetness.</p>

<p>Kissing Mrs. Maxwell a loving adieu, Viola returned
to the carriage with lovely Mae, and gave the order:</p>

<p>“Drive at once to the studio of Mr. Florian Gay.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ALIENATION.</p>


<p>How sad it is to see the waning of a beautiful friendship
between two noble hearts—friendship that should
have lasted unbroken till death—to see the cold blight
of alienation creeping in between those hearts day by
day, till naught is left of those old, sweet emotions but
the sadness of memory more cruel than forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Philip Desha and Florian Gay would never be such
fond friends again as they had been before the love of
a beautiful coquette came so fatally between their
hearts.</p>

<p>It was true that Desha had not been lacking in outward
observances such as were demanded by Florian’s
bereavement.</p>

<p>He had made the usual visit of condolence, attended
the funeral of the elder Gay, and showed no lack of
sympathy, but all the same there kept widening between
them the restraint engendered by the knowledge
that they had been unconscious rivals for the same
lovely prize.</p>

<p>Not that Desha suspected Florian’s share in humiliating
Viola upon her wedding-eve. He would have
despised his old friend had he suspected the truth, the
same as he despised himself for the folly of an hour
by which he had sundered himself from Viola forever,
repenting when all too late to atone, saying to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“It was for my sake she forgot Florian, for love of
me she sinned against my friend. It was not for me
to punish her but rather to forgive.”</p>

<p>And through the long unhappy night, when he paced
the floor of his room, restless and remorseful, the
white, stricken face of Viola, as it looked when he
had upbraided her so harshly, rose before him like an
accusing spirit, until at length love conquered everything,
and seizing a pen, he wrote to her eloquently of
his forgiveness and repentance, urging her to forget
last night and let the marriage go on according to
arrangement.</p>

<p>He sent the letter at early dawn, believing and hoping
that all would be well; but when a short while later
he opened a damp copy of the morning paper and read
her marriage notice with its glaring head-lines, it
seemed to him as if he should go mad.</p>

<p>He shut himself into his room, raging with pain and
humiliation that would have touched Viola’s heart
could she have known it, bitterly as she had longed
for such a result.</p>

<p>It was true that he had told her she might tell the
world she had jilted him, but he had scarcely expected
to be taken at his word so literally as this, having the
keen pain of jealousy of his fortunate rival mixed with
the bitter pang of loss.</p>

<p>For awhile he felt as if he could never open that
closed door again and go out to face the gibing world,
secretly laughing at his humiliation by the beautiful,
saucy coquette.</p>

<p>Then his native manliness came to his aid, helped by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
sudden hot resentment against the girl who had used
him so mercilessly in her desire for revenge.</p>

<p>He vowed that he would tear her from his heart,
that no weak woman, slight and frail, with no weapon
but beauty, should spoil the bright promise of his life
with vain regrets gnawing at his heart like canker in
a rose.</p>

</div>

<p>He fought fiercely with his sorrow and shame, and
went boldly out into the world again; but it would
have been easier to face the cannon of an opposing
army than the curious faces of his friends and acquaintances,
and even of strangers who knew him by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
sight, and pointed him out to others as a jilted bridegroom,
the latest victim of Miss Van Lew.</p>

<p>It was hard, it was cruel, it was living martyrdom,
and Viola’s deepest thirst for revenge might have
been more than satiated could she have looked into his
heart.</p>

<p>So the days came and went, but it was not so easy
to put aside the thought of Viola. The agony of loss
tugged at his heart-strings, and he grew pale and thin
and graver and quieter than ever, so that people could
not help seeing that his trouble preyed on his mind.
His cousin, Mrs. Wellford, indeed counseled him
angrily to forget Viola, reminding him how she had
always advised him against the match, saying that the
lovely coquette was not worthy of a good man’s love.</p>

<p>“I would prefer not to discuss that subject with you,
Ruby,” he replied, with a sternness that insured her
future silence, although he knew that had he felt free
to tell her the circumstances she might have viewed
everything differently.</p>

<p>But his desire to conceal his own blunder and keep
his promise to Viola, that she might give the world
any explanation she chose, held him silent.</p>

<p>“I can not vindicate either Viola or myself, let the
world say what it will,” he concluded.</p>

<p>So the time flew by, and he heard of Viola’s critical
illness and then her sudden widowhood. Perhaps
a ray of hope for future days penetrated the sadness
of his heart.</p>

<p>He heard with joy of her convalescence, and said
to himself:</p>

<p>“Her twelve months of widowhood will soon pass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
and when I come back to Congress next year—who
knows?” not acknowledging to himself that he was
glad Rolfe Maxwell was dead, yet feeling a new
spring in life.</p>

<p>He knew that Florian Gay had returned to his studio
work with renewed zest after his long play-spell, and
a sudden fancy seized him one day to call and ask if
he desired to have any more sittings on the portrait
begun last year.</p>

<p>“We used to be such good friends, it seems a pity
we should drift apart; though, of course, Florian had
terrible provocation to hate me,” he thought; but pursuing
his plan of reconciliation, he presented himself
at the studio.</p>

<p>Florian received him coldly and with reserve, secretly
resenting the visit.</p>

<p>He was working very busily, and he did not conceal
from his caller that it was Viola’s portrait he was finishing
by the efficient aid of memory.</p>

    <div class="verse indent8">“Love, unperceived,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Desha gazed long and steadily at the picture, his
heart throbbing with passion; but he made no sign,
saying, with pretended calmness:</p>

<p>“It is an ideal head and a good likeness. Memory
stands you in good stead. But how about mine? Has
it fared as well?”</p>

<p>Florian flushed up to his brow, and answered,
evasively:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“No; it did not please me somehow, and I preferred
not to finish it. So I painted out what I had begun.”</p>

<p>Desha understood, but he felt that he had no fault
to find. He changed the subject by saying:</p>

<p>“Have you any curios to show me? Anything new
from abroad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there, behind that curtain. Pray examine
them at your leisure, and excuse me for going on with
my work. It is one of my days of inspiration.”</p>

<p>He seized his brush and went doggedly to work on
Viola’s portrait, while Desha retired behind the curtain,
somewhat discomfited by his cool reception, and
thinking:</p>

<p>“He has forgiven her, it seems, by his going on with
her portrait, but I am still in his black books. Strange,
when he certainly knows I was unconsciously his rival,
and ought to give me the benefit of that knowledge.”</p>

<p>He examined the valuable curios with but a languid
interest, while Florian, with his handsome brows
drawn together in a vexed frown, and an angry
gleam in his dark eyes, painted away with great energy
on the beautiful head of his false love, thinking:</p>

<p>“The impudence of the fellow intruding here after
stealing Viola from me!”</p>

<p>Suddenly a low, musical voice came to him from
just inside the curtained door leading into the hall.
It said, cordially:</p>

<p>“How well you paint from memory!”</p>

<p>Florian turned with a start and saw, facing him, the
beautiful original of the portrait that was absorbing
all his energy.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">RIVALS STILL.</p>


<p>Philip Desha, dawdling behind the curtain, caught
the sound of that musical voice, and his heart leaped
violently with blended pain and pleasure as he thrust
aside a slight fold and peered out into the studio to
assure himself that he was not deceived, not dreaming,
but possessed of his sober senses.</p>

<p>Yes, there she stood!</p>

<p>Viola herself—not the rosy, smiling Viola of the
portrait, but a woman far more beautiful, now that
sorrow and illness had touched her with refining fingers—Viola,
pale and slender and wan, with great,
somber gray eyes gazing at him out of that exquisite
pale face, thrown into strong relief by the blackness of
her mourning garments.</p>

<p>She had a companion; but Florian scarcely noticed
the beautiful, golden-haired young creature as he
gasped in deep agitation:</p>

<p>“Viola!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Florian,” she answered, gently, coming forward
to him, and adding: “You see, I forgive you
for that night, and bear you no ill-will. Indeed, I
have come to ask a favor at your hands.”</p>

<p>“A favor?” he muttered, gazing eagerly at her pale
and lovely face, his heart beginning to thump furiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
against his side, then sinking with futile regret for that
night when his revengeful haste had lost him her heart
forever.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Well, love and pain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be kinsfolk twain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet would, oh, would, I could love again!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Viola was the more self-possessed of the two, calm,
quiet, and gently deprecating, as she repeated:</p>

<p>“Yes, a favor, but first let me present you to my
cousin, Miss Sweetland. Dear Mae, this is an old
friend of mine, Mr. Gay.”</p>

<p>They bowed to each other, and Florian could not
help seeing that the young girl was very lovely, even
when contrasted with peerless Viola.</p>

<p>He hastened to place seats for them, wondering
uneasily what Desha would think, but hoping devoutly
he would remain hidden behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Viola continued, gently and frankly:</p>

<p>“If you can forgive my past folly, and be friends
again, I wish you to paint a life-size picture for me
from a photograph of my dead husband. Will you
do it, Florian?”</p>

<p>Viola did not mean to wound him, but her words
quivered like an arrow in his heart. He started, paled,
then exclaimed, almost violently:</p>

<p>“How can you ask me? No, I will not do it!”</p>

<p>Suddenly she comprehended from his emotion the
enormity of her offense, and flushed and faltered:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry—and perhaps I ought not to have
asked you—but I knew you could do it better than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
one else. Forgive me, and—good-bye,” her voice
breaking as she moved toward the door.</p>

<p>But at that moment Philip Desha came quickly from
behind the curtain and placed himself in her way.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for detaining you—Mrs. Maxwell,”
he exclaimed, eagerly. “But—but—since our
good friend Florian is so busy, will you let me recommend
a very talented artist whom I know quite well?”</p>

<p>Viola started, paled, and trembled at the sound of
his voice, and her heart smote her with remorse as
she gazed into his face and saw what a change had
come over it since their parting. With an effort she
murmured:</p>

<p>“If you will be so kind, I shall indeed be most grateful.”</p>

<p>Pretty Mae, looking on at the agitation of all three,
wondered to herself at the cause of it all.</p>

<p>Florian seized with sudden jealousy of Desha,
thought, angrily:</p>

<p>“How clever he is, trying to ingratiate himself with
her again! I will forestall his plans, no matter what
pangs it costs my own heart!”</p>

<p>Hurrying forward, he exclaimed, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Viola, I was hasty in refusing. Indeed, I should
like to oblige you in this matter, if you are not in
too great a hurry over it. Could you give me three
months?”</p>

<p>“Yes; for I am going South in a few days, to be
absent several months, so that I should be quite satisfied
to have it done by the time of my return,” she
cried, sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“Then I will undertake it,” he replied, glad to disappoint
Desha’s scheme.</p>

<p>Viola took out the fine cabinet photograph of Rolfe
Maxwell and handed it to him in silent emotion, while
both men gazed with interest at the handsome rival
who had seized the prize they had let slip from their
grasp.</p>

<p>Florian’s heart throbbed with keen jealousy of the
dead man, and Desha uttered a cry of recognition and
surprise.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Viola, turning eagerly to him;
and he answered:</p>

<p>“I thought I had never seen the man you married,
but I recognized him instantly as the young man who
saved your life the day you skated through the ice.
But of course he told you?”</p>

<p>Viola’s eyes flashed through starting tears.</p>

<p>“No; he did not tell me! Can it really be true?”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mae Sweetland clasped her hand, and answered,
unexpectedly:</p>

<p>“Yes, Viola; it is quite true. Rolfe confessed it
all to Aunt Margaret during the illness that followed
his wetting and exposure that day. He was so modest
that he would never permit his name to be known,
though he almost died of pneumonia afterward.”</p>

<p>Viola put her handkerchief to her face, sobbing:</p>

<p>“I have all the more reason to love his memory.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Desha looked curiously at the lovely
young stranger, and Florian hastened to present her as
Viola’s cousin, while Mae added:</p>

<p>“I was Rolfe Maxwell’s cousin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>They both wondered why Maxwell had not lost his
heart to this artless beauty before he ever saw Viola,
but of course they could not utter their thoughts aloud,
and the embarrassing scene quickly ended by Viola
dashing the tears from her eyes and wishing them a
faltering good-bye as she moved to the door with Mae
by her side.</p>

<p>The two men were left alone standing, with the
portrait of the dead man upturned to their eyes in
Florian’s hand.</p>

<p>“Deuced handsome beggar!” he growled; then, after
a pause: “It was clever in him to go off and die like
that, and leave her free, eh?”</p>

<p>“It seems heartless to the dead to say so,” Desha
answered, generously; and then there fell an embarrassing
silence.</p>

<p>Florian broke it by saying, abruptly:</p>

<p>“Let us be frank with each other. Viola is free
again. She has served us each a bad turn, yet I believe
we have both got over our rage, and love her still.
Am I right?”</p>

<p>Philip Desha sighed as he answered:</p>

<p>“You are right.”</p>

<p>“That is what I thought,” answered Florian, sullenly;
adding: “I give you fair warning that I intend
to woo Viola for the second time.”</p>

<p>A quick flash came to Desha’s blue eyes, and he said,
firmly:</p>

<p>“You understand that I shall be your rival?”</p>

<p>“I feared so. You stole her from me once, and no
doubt you will do so again, if possible,” Florian replied
with bitterness, his lips curling in a sneer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Desha would have been angry with any one else but
Florian, but he understood the young man’s fiery temper
and pitied his sorrow, not dreaming of the slight
he also had put upon Viola on her wedding-eve.</p>

<p>Gazing reproachfully at the young man, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Are you doing me justice, Florian?”</p>

<p>“Justice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, justice! You must surely be aware that when
I became a suitor for Viola’s hand I was ignorant of
any claim you had on her heart.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it, and I have made due allowance
for the fact; but if you wish me to forgive you and
to atone for the past, the way is clear.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Give up your pretensions to her hand, and leave
the field clear for me to win her again,” boldly answered
Florian.</p>

<p>Philip Desha reflected in anguish a moment, then
answered, firmly:</p>

<p>“I can not yield to you in this matter, Florian, because
I must consider Viola’s happiness as well as my
own. I believe she loves me still, and that she only
married Maxwell out of pique because we quarreled
on our wedding-eve and broke our engagement. Under
present circumstances I hold myself loyally bound
to her still if she will accept me.”</p>

<p>“Then you and I are henceforth rivals and enemies,”
Florian cried, violently, and Desha bowed in silence,
and took an abrupt leave.</p>

<p class="center">“COULD YE COME BACK TO ME, DOUGLAS, DOUGLAS!”</p>


<p>Viola reached home after leaving Mae at the cottage
in a whirl of conflicting emotions—pride in her dead
husband’s heroism, anger at her father’s duplicity.</p>

<p>“How excited you look, Viola. I believe you were
imprudent in going out this afternoon,” cried the
judge, solicitously.</p>

<p>Viola’s somber gray eyes flashed sudden lightning
as she cried:</p>

<p>“I would not have missed going for anything in
the world, for I have found out two very important
things today.”</p>

<p>Aunt Edwina cried out instantly with lively curiosity:</p>

<p>“What were they, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, auntie, how surprised you will be when I tell
you that I have found out who saved my life that day
on the ice when I came so near being drowned!”
proudly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Herman groaned to herself:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, is that romance going to crop up again?”
But aloud she said, placidly: “Yes, dear!”</p>

<p>Viola threw her arms about the old lady, and cried,
sobbingly:</p>

<p>“Only think, it was he, my own dear, deeply injured
Rolfe!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Not Rolfe Maxwell!” cried the judge, starting to
his feet in surprise.</p>

<p>“Rolfe Maxwell, and no other!” Viola replied, a
deep flush kindling in her cheek as she lifted her head,
and added:</p>

<p>“Rolfe Maxwell, the noble young hero whom you so
generously rewarded for twice saving the life of your
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Rewarded!” stammered the judge, growing pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, rewarded by treachery and falsehood, sending
him away from his bride to meet a cruel death, his
heart already broken by the thought that I was ungrateful,
and repudiated my marriage vows. You,
my father, whom I believed so noble and high-minded,
invented cruel falsehoods to drive my husband away
from me forever! And your cruel schemes, alas succeeded
but too well. His death lies at your door!”
cried Viola, in passionate reproach, her heart burning
with a sense of her wrongs.</p>

<p>“Viola, how did you learn these things?” groaned
the judge, and she answered, frankly:</p>

<p>“From his poor, bereaved mother, in whom he confided
before he went away to meet a cruel death at the
hands of the wicked Spaniards.”</p>

<p>There followed a shocked silence, the judge realizing
how bitterly he had erred, and how hopeless was
the thought of any atonement to the man who lay in
his untimely grave.</p>

<p>He was a proud, reserved man, and it was hard to
confess himself in the wrong, and ask forgiveness of
the daughter, who such a little while ago was a pretty,
willful child whom he had scolded for her heartlessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>But Viola was a woman now, hurried out of girlishness
by a great trouble. She had gained a wonderful
dignity that almost awed him, while her keen
reproaches cut him to the heart.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to make her think as well as she
could of him under the cruel circumstances, he put
aside pride and reserve, and answered, humbly:</p>

<p>“Dear child, I was in the wrong, but I did it for your
sake. I believed you had married Maxwell out of
pique, while still loving Philip Desha, and when you
fainted dead away on receiving his letter of repentance,
my suspicions were confirmed. When I invented
the stories that sent Rolfe Maxwell away, I did it for
your sake, believing you would be glad to be free
again to renew your vows with Desha. If I made a
grave mistake, as your words imply, I can only crave
your pardon in all humility. My judgment was at
fault, but my heart was true, and my remorse since
poor Maxwell’s death has been keen and bitter, though
so silent.”</p>

<p>She saw the signs of suffering on his pale grave
face, and read them in his tremulous voice, and her
heart was softened.</p>

<p>She cried in anguish:</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, I would give the world to undo the
wrong done my dead husband! to have him back
again, and tell him I love him for his bravery and for
all he has suffered for my sake! But that is forever
impossible, and I can only love him dead, and hope to
meet him in another world, and so for the sake of that
dear hope, that I may be good enough to attain future
happiness, I must forgive you all you did in your mistaken
zeal for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>She gave him her cold little hand, and let him kiss
her tear-wet face, then hurried to her own room, to
kneel down and weep the passionate tears of a vain
despair.</p>

<p>The next day Judge Van Lew called his daughter
into the library, and said, tenderly:</p>

<p>“My dear, I have a little plan to make atonement
as far as possible for the wrong I did you.”</p>

<p>Viola gazed at him wonderingly; and he added:</p>

<p>“You remember, I refused in the heat of anger to
permit you to have the fortune your mother willed
you on your marriage, because you had not complied
with the conditions set; but I am now convinced that
I did wrong. Maxwell was a noble young man, after
all, and if he were alive now I would welcome him as
a son-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, papa!” she exclaimed, with a gratified
smile; and he added:</p>

<p>“When your mother died her private fortune was
a quarter of a million, and by judicious investments I
have doubled the amount. Here are the necessary
papers that make you mistress of a half million dollars,
and if you can make this contribute to the happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
that my error so cruelly jeopardized, I shall be more
than gratified.”</p>

<p>Viola did not feel as if the wealth of the world
could add to her happiness just now, but she would
not wound her father by telling him the truth. She
accepted his gift in the same loving spirit in which it
was conferred, thanking him with a tender caress, and
saying that she should not know what to do with so
much money.</p>

<p>Her heart cried in secret:</p>

<p>“Oh, if Rolfe were but alive to share it with me,
how happy we might be! Alas! I can never be happy
now, for I have learned too late that I loved him with
a passion never dreamed of when I fancied myself in
love with others!”</p>

<p class="center">THE PORTRAIT.</p>


<p>Viola’s physician had said that she must have change
of scene, and at first she had rebelled, preferring to
remain at home and brood over her troubles.</p>

<p>But with the lapse of time she began to see that it
would be wiser to go away.</p>

<p>As soon as she became convalescent, her social world
turned out <i>en masse</i> to make calls of condolence on the
lovely young widow.</p>

<p>From a few she met real sympathy, from the many
that veiled curiosity that drives one frantic.</p>

<p>She could guess but too easily how they wondered
and gossiped over her affairs, blaming her for jilting
Desha, asking each other what sensational freak she
would indulge in next.</p>

<p>It was torture to the sensitive girl, who looked back
with keen regret to those thoughtless days when she
had played with men’s hearts as toys, never stopping
to think until brought to bay by her father’s reprimand
and the terrible affair of young Merrington.</p>

<p>When Viola thought of that, and how narrowly she
had escaped life-long remorse at his death, she always
shuddered with fear and renewed her vows never to
flirt again.</p>

<p>But the carping world could not guess at her remorse
and penitence, and she knew well that hard things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
were whispered of her on the sly, even while the
speakers smiled their sweetest, pretending friendship
of which they were incapable.</p>

<p>Ah, how cold and hollow is the world, and how
little truth is found in the human heart!—just here and
there one pure, white, noble soul, disdaining every
petty meanness, lonely on earth because its mates are
so few.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ah, the bewildering masquerade of Life,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Viola grew frantic with secret impatience of her
life. She decided to fly from her embarrassments by
seeking change of scene, as advised by the thoughtful
physician.</p>

<p>A trip to the South was at first projected, but suddenly
Viola changed her mind and decided to go
abroad. She wanted to put the whole width of the
ocean between herself and every haunting reminder of
the past.</p>

<p>She asked her father if he could accompany her; but
he frankly said that nothing was more impossible,
although nothing would have pleased him better.</p>

<p>“You see, my dear, I can not desert my post,” he
explained. “This year of 1896 will witness the presidential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
campaign, and I must be, as ever, in the thick
of the political fight. My party will need me, and I
must remain at the post of duty, much as I would love
to accompany you. Can you not make the tour chaperoned
by your aunt and a maid?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Herman, who was timid and nervous, cried out
in alarm that she would as soon be asked to cross the
river of Styx as the dangerous Atlantic. No, no;
Viola must take some one else. She was getting too
old to go junketing about the world, and would rather
stay at home and keep her brother comfortable.</p>

<p>Viola was discomfited at first, then a bright thought
flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>“Why, there is Mrs. Maxwell!” she cried. “The
dear old lady is quite alone in her little cottage, because
Mae went away yesterday to make a long visit
to some country relations.”</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew answered quite affably:</p>

<p>“Take Mrs. Maxwell, if you choose, my dear. It
would be a very proper arrangement.”</p>

<p>And when Viola went to see about it she did not
find her hard to persuade, she had such pleasant recollections
of two previous journeys across the ocean in
better days.</p>

<p>“One was my bridal trip, dear, and the other when
Rolfe was fifteen years old. Ah, how my poor boy
enjoyed that summer abroad!” she sighed, wiping away
the quick, starting tears.</p>

<p>Viola wept, too, in sympathy, and said, tenderly:</p>

<p>“We will visit all the places he liked best, and you
shall tell me all he said and did there. It will be like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
getting better acquainted with my husband, whom I
knew such a little while.”</p>

<p>It was setting a pleasant task for the bereaved
mother, this rehearsing the past sayings and doings
of her beloved dead. Such stories as she could tell
Viola of Rolfe’s bright ways, his manliness, his tenderness,
his bravery, were enough to thrill any woman’s
heart, and Viola grew to know him well, now he was
gone, and the aching cry of her heart grew more intense
with time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Could ye come back to me, Douglas, Douglas!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the golden May-time they journeyed across the
ocean, leaving the little cottage boarded up and deserted,
so that weeks later, when the postman opened
the gate with a letter that would have brought gladness
to the mourner’s heart, there was no one to receive it,
and the neighbors said Mrs. Maxwell had gone away
weeks before, and they did not know her address.</p>

<p>The postman sent the letter to the Dead Letter
Office, marked “Can not be found,” and several bulky
ones that followed it shared the same fate, until by
autumn they ceased to come, the writer evidently giving
up in despair. It could not have been Mae Sweetland,
for she knew that her aunt was in Europe, and
kept up an animated correspondence with her and
Viola, so it was quite a mystery who could have been
sending those letters to Mrs. Maxwell.</p>

<p>To pretty Mae Sweetland Viola had intrusted the
task of seeing now and then after the progress of
Rolfe’s portrait; for, as she assured Mae, the artist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
was very indolent, and would never apply himself to
the task unless goaded to it by pertinacious attention.</p>

<p>So now and then Mae came up to Washington with
her cousins on little pleasure trips, and they always
invaded Florian’s studio, sometimes finding him there,
but oftener out, for he worked but seldom, since the
prize for which he consented to paint the portrait, the
hope of Viola’s occasional visits, was denied by her
lengthened absence.</p>

<p>He had thought she would be coming every week to
see how his work progressed, and that they would
gradually return to the footing of the dear old days
before he had been forced away from his fickle betrothed,
leaving her to forget him in the fascinations
of an unsuspected rival.</p>

<p>Florian thought he would have an easy task ousting
Desha from her heart, and that they would mutually
forgive each other, and marry happily after all their
ups and downs; but things looked different somehow
when he learned that she was sailing for Europe for an
indefinite stay, and had deputed to that golden-haired
fairy, Miss Sweetland, the task of watching the progress
of Rolfe’s portrait.</p>

<p>Mae was very shy, and she dreaded the visits to the
handsome artist, who at first was rather curt and indifferent
in his disappointment over Viola, and made
careless excuses for not having begun the portrait
when Mae made her third call in the month of July.</p>

<p>“Too hot to work now. I’ve concluded not to begin
till fall,” he said; then started as he saw quick tears
sparkle in her lovely blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, how grieved Viola will be! The disappointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
will quite break her heart!” she cried; and
Florian smiled cynically.</p>

<p>Mae continued, reproachfully:</p>

<p>“You promised it in three months, you know, and
now you break your promise so easily. How can you
be so cruel?”</p>

<p>“How spirited the little thing is!” he thought, looking
at her with suddenly aroused interest.</p>

<p>“So you think me cruel, Miss Sweetland? Well,
I dare say I deserve it! But would you be willing to
make a personal sacrifice to induce me to give over my
indolence and begin your cousin’s portrait?”</p>

<p>“Name it,” she replied, hopefully; and Florian said,
in one of his daring moods:</p>

<p>“It is dull work painting from a photograph. I
prefer living subjects when possible, and I have a
great desire to copy your face for an ideal picture
I mean to paint. Will you give me two sittings each
week if I will promise to work all the intervening
time on Mr. Maxwell’s portrait?”</p>

<p>Mae dimpled and blushed and looked inquiringly
at her cousin, Mrs. Graham, who said, decisively:</p>

<p>“Yes, I will bring her twice a week for the sittings;
and mind that you have Rolfe’s portrait commenced
the next time we come.”</p>

<p>When Mae’s letter went across the sea, telling all
this, Viola smiled roguishly to herself at the success
of the design she had formed against Florian the
day she first took Mae to his studio.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“Whom first we love, you know, we seldom wed.”</p>


<p>The portrait of Rolfe Maxwell was finished, and
awaited Viola’s return.</p>

<p>It hung upon Florian’s studio wall—a magnificent
likeness of the handsome, dark-eyed original that
would delight Viola’s tender heart.</p>

<p>Florian himself had written to tell her how well
he had succeeded in his undertaking, and how anxious
he was to hear her verdict of well done.</p>

<p>The young widow had written promptly, expressing
her fervent gratitude, and gracefully offering the
most liberal compensation.</p>

<p>Florian had quite as gracefully disclaimed the intention
of receiving any reward for his work, save
the longed for guerdon of her forgiveness for the
madness of an hour that he would willingly lay down
his life to recall. Could Viola find this forgiveness
in her heart?</p>

<p>In reply came the most charming letter. Was it
possible her dear friend could think she harbored
malice for that fatal night?</p>

<p>No, no; she had deserved it all, and more, and
accepted her punishment in all humility. He and
Philip Desha had both taught her a lesson for which
she was profoundly grateful. She was a changed girl
now, and had firmly resolved never to flirt again. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
hoped Florian would forget the past, just as she was
trying to do.</p>

<p>When Florian replied, thanking her ardently for
her forgiveness, and vaguely hinting at a continuance
of the correspondence, she did not answer, and it
carried a bitter pang to his heart; but he determined
to bide his time in patience. No doubt she wished
to spend the year of widowhood in proper seclusion.</p>

<p>But that was months and months ago, and Viola
still lingered abroad, although Christmas had come
and gone, and it was 1897 now, so that in a very
short time she would have been widowed a year.
Of course Desha would be making up to her again
then, and Florian determined to get ahead of him
if possible.</p>

<p>He was tempted to take a little run over to Europe
and try his fate again, but when he hinted of such
a possible trip to his mother, she opposed it so strenuously,
alleging her weak health and loneliness, that
he gave up the idea, and wrote instead to Viola,
pouring out all his hopes and fears, and again laying
heart and hand at her feet.</p>

<p>He waited most impatiently for the answer, and
in those days of suspense stood often before her
completed portrait as it stood on the easel brightening
the room with its arch beauty, while close beside
it hung the fancy head he had made of Mae Sweetland,
a Cupid emerging from light-tinted clouds such
as suited her fairy-like beauty. It was a fine likeness
and a lovely piece of work, and Florian took much
pride in it, often saying to himself:</p>

<p>“Jove! what a little angel! If I had not met Viola<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
first, I should certainly have been a captive to Mae’s
bow and spear.”</p>

<p>He would not admit even to himself that it was perhaps
a feeling of loyalty to Viola that had made him
avoid Mae after the portrait was finished, afraid of a
sudden indefinable attraction that she had begun to
exercise over him, lest his thoughts should stray from
her who had the first claim on them.</p>

<p>He had not seen Mae for some time, but he knew
she was back in the city this winter, because he had
met Mrs. Graham accidentally on the street one day,
and on asking eagerly after the young girl, had been
told that she was staying at a boarding-house near the
Capitol, till her aunt should return from abroad.</p>

<p>He had asked for her address, and said he would
call on her very soon; and Mrs. Graham duly reported
it to Mae, who watched eagerly, day by day, until she
gave up in despair, for he never came.</p>

<p>“He does not care,” she thought to herself, wondering
if he was not something of a flirt; for he had certainly
seemed to take a flattering interest in her during
the painting of the portraits. “I am almost sorry
I gave him those sittings now. He is very ungrateful
not even to call once. But I shall not fret, though
he is very handsome; for I gave my heart unasked
once, and I never shall again,” she resolved, valiantly
fighting down her heart pangs.</p>

<p>She was very lovely and winning, and in the select
boarding-house where she was staying with a very
distant relative, she found many admirers who gave
her little time to bewail the indifference of one cold
cavalier; for her invitations were many, and she received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
enough attentions to turn her golden head, if
she had not been quite a self-poised little creature
whose one disappointment in love had been sufficient
to check any budding vanity.</p>

<p>But one evening in January when she was sitting
quietly in her room, with an interesting new novel, a
card was brought her that sent a sudden, warm, sea-shell
glow flushing into her fair cheeks, for it bore the
name of Florian Gay.</p>

<p>“At last!” she thought, in a flutter of mingled delight
and pique, and hastened to make herself as irresistible
as she could by the aid of dress before descending
to her relative’s private parlor, where she
found Florian eagerly awaiting her, and looking marvelously
handsome in his dark, cavalier style.</p>

<p>“Are you surprised?” he queried, pressing the tiny
hand a trifle more warmly than was necessary, so
that she blushingly drew it away.</p>

<p>“I was certainly not expecting you,” she replied;
and his quick ear caught the tone of irrepressible pique
in her voice.</p>

<p>“I knew you were in the city, and I have been dying
to call on you; but you would never guess in a hundred
years the strange reason that has kept me away,”
cried Florian, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, curiously; and he hastened to
explain:</p>

<p>“I did not come because I was afraid of falling
in love with you.”</p>

<p>Mae started with surprise and confusion, the long
lashes drooping to her crimson cheeks, while Florian
continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“I was afraid of falling in love with you, because
I found you almost irresistible, and I thought myself
in honor bound to another whom I had loved
before I ever met you. But now I am free from that
fancied bond, and perhaps I ought to tell you all about
it before I risk my fate with you. Do you care to
listen, little one?” tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes; oh, yes,” she smiled encouragingly, her young
heart throbbing wildly with a strange, new joy.</p>

<p>Thereupon Florian valiantly rehearsed for her benefit
the story of his eventful love affair with Viola, taking
due blame to himself for his hasty revenge that
had recoiled so heavily on his own heart.</p>

<p>“When I came to my senses and longed to make
reparation for my folly, she had recklessly bound herself
to another,” he said. “But when death so soon
snapped that bond, I resolved to try my fate again,
holding myself loyally bound to her if she cared to
take me. I still loved her madly until—those days
when you gave me the sittings for your portrait, when
I found my allegiance wavering under the spell of
your charms, until I saw that to be true to Viola I
must avoid you. I did so until her year of widowhood
was so nearly ended that I thought I might propose
without giving offense. This was several weeks ago,
and a while ago I received her answer—a very kind
rejection.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Mae.</p>

<p>“A rejection,” repeated Florian, frankly; and added:
“But it did not hurt me so badly as might have
been expected, because you had divided my thoughts
with her so long that on reading her letter my heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
quickly rebounded from the blow and turned with a
new, sweet hope to you.”</p>

<p>What a strange wooing this was, thought Mae, who
did not relish taking the half of a heart only; and she
cried in pique:</p>

<p>“If she had wanted you I should never have been
given another thought!”</p>

<p>“It would have been wrong to think of you then,
but now I can think of nothing else!” cried Florian,
frankly, and his handsome face took on a very pleading
look as he added: “Oh, Mae, are you going to
be cruel to me because I was frank and honest with
you, fearing you might hear my story from some
others? It is best to own that I loved Viola dearly
once, but now my heart is all your own, and will never
stray again if you will accept its devotion, believing
that it is possible to give love twice.”</p>

<p>Mae did not answer, for a swift pain cleft her heart,
and a red flush burned her face as her lover added:</p>

<p>“Young, romantic girls like you may imagine that
it is not possible to love twice, but indeed it is not
true. If you will let me teach you the sweet lesson
of love, you shall be adored as devotedly as ever Viola
was.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” she murmured, faintly; and the tears
flashed into her soft blue eyes. She was thinking,
sweet Mae, of her own broken love-dream.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whom first we love, you know, we seldom wed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She dashed away the tears, and murmured, softly:</p>

<p>“I am not blaming you, for—for I know you speak
truly. I will be as frank as you. I, too, have loved—but
he is dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>She bent her face in her hands, and the tears fell
through her fingers, thinking of her brief, broken love-dream
so pitifully ended.</p>

<p>Yes, it was all over now. She was not sore and
angry over it any longer, realizing, as Florian had
said, that it was possible to love twice.</p>

<p>He was startled and surprised, scarcely dreaming
that so young a girl had already loved, but he did not
ask her any questions, simply drew away the little
hands from her face and kissed the wet fingertips, saying
gently:</p>

<p>“Can we not fold down these sad pages in our
hearts, dear Mae, and begin again with a new love
and a new hope for the future? I will be as patient
as you wish me, waiting for your answer as long as
you desire, so that you give me a spark of hope now.”</p>

<p>And looking in her tender eyes, he read that he need
not wait an hour, for his devotion had touched the
smoldering spark of love into flame.</p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, and whispered:</p>

<p>“God bless you, darling! I will try to make you
the happiest woman in the world. And as for Viola,
I suppose she is in love with Desha still, and he will
get her in the end. I will hunt him up tomorrow and
renew our old friendship, telling him that I am engaged
to the sweetest girl on earth, and no longer his
rival and enemy.”</p>

<p>And thus ended successfully the little plot of Viola
to console Florian and Mae for their former disappointments
by making them fall in love with each
other.</p>

<p class="center">IN HER TOILS AGAIN.</p>


<p>Who was so happy as Viola when she received
Florian’s frank letter explaining everything in his inimitable
manner, and asking her congratulations on
his engagement to Mae.</p>

<p>The thought that her old lover was happy at last
lightened the weight of remorse on her mind, and
made her smile with joy as she thought:</p>

<p>“I hope to hear just such good news some time of
George Merrington and the others. Perhaps even
Philip Desha may find consolation.”</p>

<p>She and Mother Maxwell exchanged congratulations,
for Mae had written her aunt by the same post,
telling of her happiness.</p>

<p>“Florian is a splendid match for sweet Mae—young,
rich, talented, and good. She will be very happy, I am
sure,” cried Viola; adding: “He says he wants to be
married in May, so I think, mother dear, that I shall
slip over to Paris, select a handsome <i>trousseau</i> as my
wedding-gift to our dear girl, and then we will turn
our faces homeward, so as to assist at the wedding.”</p>

<p>So, when the snow-drops and crocus began to star
the greensward in early March, Viola came home
again to her father and aunt, who had fretted sorely
over her absence, though they had not complained, because,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
as Aunt Edwina naively said, they hoped she
was “getting over things.”</p>

<p>Whether she had “got over things” or not, Viola
did not say. She was even more beautiful, if that
were possible, than before she went abroad; but it was
not the arch beauty of the girl Viola, but the
chastened loveliness of the woman who has suffered,
and gained depth of feeling and nobility by her experience.
In her great, luminous gray eyes lurked a
haunting sadness, and her smile had a pensive expression
unknown to it before.</p>

<p>Her first visit was made to the portrait still waiting
for her at the studio.</p>

<p>“You will leave me alone with it, please, Florian,”
she said, with a quivering lip; and he retired with Mae
to the alcove, where in sweet lovers’ talk they took no
note of the time that flew while Viola remained motionless
before the portrait, gazing with humid eyes
at the likeness so faithfully transferred to canvas
thinking:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she turned away at last, and sought Florian
with outstretched hand, she faltered:</p>

<p>“It is perfect. I can find no words strong enough
for my gratitude.”</p>

<p>“It is enough that I have pleased you,” the artist
answered, gladly; and then she and Mae took leave,
promising to bring Mrs. Maxwell to the studio tomorrow,
after which the portrait would be removed to her
own home.</p>

<p>Florian was deeply puzzled over Viola’s emotion,
thinking:</p>

<p>“It looks somehow as if she really loved the fellow
after all; but I do not understand it, for she certainly
married him out of pure pique after being jilted
by Desha, whom she claimed to love so dearly. Well,
these women, they are past finding out.”</p>

<p>Viola accompanied Mae to the cottage, and they
spent several hours unpacking the boxes of beautiful
things she had brought for the <i>trousseau</i>.</p>

<p>Mae was wild with delight and gratitude. She sobbed
on Viola’s neck:</p>

<p>“I do not deserve your goodness. There were weeks
when I hated you and almost wished you dead.”</p>

<p>“That is all past now, dear. Let us forget it,”
Viola answered, with a smothered sigh, as she held up
a pattern of pale-blue brocade against Mae’s face,
adding, admiringly: “This silver hue is very becoming
to your complexion, Mae.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>She had sighed at thought of her own exquisite
<i>trousseau</i> lying unworn, even to the bridal gown, in
her trunks at home. What happy hours she had spent
over the costly robes fated never to be worn, she
thought, stifling the unbidden sigh that heaved her
breast.</p>

<p>When she went home she found that several friends
had already called, and among the cards was that of
Philip Desha. She smiled a little bitterly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks, like Florian, that he should
be loyal to me till I give him an honorable discharge.
Well, that will be easy enough.”</p>

<p>But Desha did not call again for some time. It was
Inauguration Week, and some of his Northern friends
were in the city. In showing them the proper courtesies
he found no time for any one else, so that at
the last he met Viola first elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was at a reception, one of the first given by
the new President. She had unwillingly accompanied
her father and aunt, lightening her somber black for
the occasion by some bunches of white and purple
violets.</p>

<p>They had paid their respects to the new Executive
and were getting out of the crush when he came to
her side, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>Viola held out her tiny black-gloved hand.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Professor Desha, and sorry
I was not at home when you called last week.”</p>

<p>It was the graceful <i>aplomb</i> of the woman of the
world, mixed with cordiality that went a little deeper.
His heart leaped quickly as he pressed her hand, and
asked, eagerly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“Then I may take the privilege of coming again?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she answered, with the gleam of a
gracious smile; and then the crowd swept them apart,
and a few people who had observed the meeting, with
surprise, nudged each other, observing:</p>

<p>“The audacious little flirt! Not out of her mourning
yet, and she has got the foolish fellow into her
toils again! Has he neither sense nor pride?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“IT WAS PIQUE, NOT LOVE.”</p>


<p>Days passed, and with their flight Viola took up the
threads of her home life again, but with a subtle difference.</p>

<p>The light-hearted gayety of other days had faded
from her brow, and a pensive shadow replaced it.
She cared no more for society, declining all invitations
on the score of her mourning. She spent many
hours alone before the portrait of Rolfe Maxwell, that
had been hung in her favorite room. Each day she
placed fresh flowers on a stand before it.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew and his sister looked on indulgently.
They thought it was remorse that dictated these expressions
of feeling; they could not believe that Viola
had learned to love her husband of an hour. She
would get over this morbid grief presently and make
up with Desha.</p>

<p>“It is this somber black she wears that saddens her
mind. The year will soon be over, and I shall persuade
her to lay it aside and be her own bright self
again,” said Aunt Edwina, consolingly; and that very
evening she said, coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Dear, do you know it almost breaks your poor
papa’s heart to see you always in that heavy, dismal
black? Besides, he considers it quite prejudicial to
your health. Now, won’t you please us, dear, by laying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
it aside in the evenings for something lighter in
white or lavender?”</p>

<p>Viola knew how they doted on her, and how she
had grieved their hearts by her long stay abroad. She
did not refuse, and permitted her aunt to select a soft
white merino gown from her wardrobe, and have the
maid trim it with pale lavender ribbons and dainty
white chiffon. Then with great, odorous clusters of
purple violets on her breast and in her hair, she went
down to her father, who started with delight, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“What a delightful change, my dear! Now you
look more like my little girl Viola, and perhaps you
will play and sing for me again?”</p>

<p>Viola was in an acquiescent mood. She granted
his request, though she had never before touched the
piano since she came home. She tried to put her
heart into the work, playing all he asked for, even
singing again, and he noticed her voice had lost none
of its beauty or power, only gained a deeper pathos
that made it irresistible.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of the singing, a caller was
announced—Professor Desha.</p>

<p>Viola greeted him with no apparent embarrassment,
only she wished in her heart that she had still worn
her black gown, and wondered if papa and Aunt Edwina
had known of his coming.</p>

<p>But her hasty glance at their faces showed no consciousness,
only surprise, and in a little while they had
slipped away, and she found herself alone with her
old lover—alone for the first time since that March
night almost a year ago when they had quarreled so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
bitterly, and he had gone away in anger, leaving her a
jilted bride, mad with shame and misery.</p>

<p>It all rushed over them both, and they could not
speak of indifferent things. Desha cried, passionately:</p>

<p>“Viola, you surely understand why I have come?”</p>

<p>She smiled strangely, thinking that, like Florian, he
wanted to pay his debt and get it over.</p>

<p>She resolved that she would permit him to do so as
soon as possible, wishing also to have it over.</p>

<p>Desha’s eyes glowed with excitement as he said:</p>

<p>“Viola—if you will permit me to call you again by
that sweet name—you received my letter sent to you
on the morning of the day that was to have witnessed
our wedding?”</p>

<p>She inclined her dark head in silent assent, and the
exquisite odor of the violets on her breast floated out
to him entrancingly, intoxicating his senses till he
longed to crush her against his heart, whispering to her
of all his love and repentance and despair.</p>

<p>But there was no encouragement to such daring in
her distant, half-weary pose as she waited for his next
words, her large, brilliant eyes fixed on his pale, intellectual
face, while she wondered how it had ever commanded
her love.</p>

<p>“Then, dearest, you know how soon and how bitterly
I repented the momentary madness of that night,
when in my pride and anger I left you, declining to
fulfill my engagement of the morrow. You know
how I repented and begged you to take me back, but
you can never dream of the anguish I endured when
I learned that you were wedded to another—lost to
me forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Viola remembered repentantly how revengefully she
had planned this suffering for him and gloated on the
thought of it, and was silent.</p>

<p>“But I will not dwell on this past unhappy year,
Viola. Suffice it to say that I have suffered enough to
atone for the folly of that night—enough even to win
your pity and forgiveness. And you are free again,
and I grasp at the bare chance of going back to the
past that promised such happiness for us both. Oh,
Viola, I love you still, more passionately if possible
than a year ago, because your loss has taught me your
value! Dearest, has your heart grown cold to me, or
can you give me a little hope?”</p>

<p>“How much in earnest he seems, yet perhaps, like
Florian, he can be easily consoled for his disappointment,”
thought Viola, as she nerved herself to say,
gently:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry you have loved me all this while,
because I can not give you any hope.”</p>

<p>“Is this resentment at my folly, Viola? Do you
wish to put me on probation, to punish me as I deserve?
Do so if you will, but I shall not complain if
only you will try to love me again,” Philip Desha answered
her, with sad patience and wistful hope.</p>

<p>Viola was touched by his humility—so touched that
her voice trembled as she twined her white fingers
nervously together, replying:</p>

<p>“It is best to be frank with you, is it not? Then
believe me, I bear you no resentment for that eventful
night, and I do not wish to punish you for anything—least
of all for what you did that night, because—because—everything
turned out for the best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Viola!” incredulously.</p>

<p>“For the best,” she repeated, firmly; adding: “I
am glad I did not marry you that day, for I found out
that I did not love you after all.”</p>

<p>If the solid earth had opened at his feet, Philip
Desha could not have been more astonished than at
that declaration from Viola.</p>

<p>His thoughts ran hastily back over the past, and
he remembered how easily she had been wooed, and
how much she had seemed to love him. He decided
that it was pride and pique that moved her now. He
would have to overcome both before he could win her
back.</p>

<p>A deep flush rose to her pale, beautiful face, and
she cried, hastily:</p>

<p>“I know that you do not believe me—that you are
looking back over the past and saying to yourself that
I gave you every encouragement to love me, that I
even led you on, and almost entrapped you into proposing
that night when you fell and hurt yourself, and
in my fright I said the most silly things—”</p>

<p>“The most charming things—words that kindled
hope in my despairing heart and made me the happiest
of men!” interrupted her lover, fervently.</p>

<p>Still blushing warmly, Viola continued:</p>

<p>“I actually believed myself very much in love with
you, and when I tell you what a disposition I have,
you will readily understand my mistake.”</p>

<p>He bowed and waited, while she went on, frankly:</p>

<p>“As a child I always wanted most ardently whatever
was refused to me, and brought every energy to
bear until I attained its possession, only to find out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
afterward that I cared nothing for it whatever, and
had only struggled for it out of the inherent perversity
of a nature that adored the unattainable. My nurse
related that I often cried for the moon.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, startled at his deepening pallor,
then made the confession:</p>

<p>“I met you several times in society, Professor
Desha, and I did not actually give you a second
thought until a rival belle, a spiteful girl, told me
frankly how very strongly you had expressed your
disapprobation of me in general, deploring the fact
that any true man’s heart could be wrecked by such
a heartless butterfly. In my anger and resentment I
marked you at once for a victim of my charms.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, in actual pain at her confession.</p>

<p>“It was wicked, and I am ashamed of it now, but
I promised to be frank, and I will not spare myself,”
cried Viola; adding: “Yes, I angled for your
heart with all the arts of the finished coquette, but you
withstood me so valiantly that you awakened that trait
in my nature, that longing for whatever was denied
me. It grew on me till it possessed me, fooled me,
made me believe you actually necessary to my heart.
Pique and vanity masqueraded in the garb of love.
I won you, and believed that I was happy. Then came
that night!”</p>

<p>He was about to speak, but she held up her hand,
saying:</p>

<p>“Wait till I have done. Will you listen to the story
of what happened that night after you left me?”</p>

<p>He bowed his head, and Viola began by telling him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
to his great surprise, how she had tried to recall Florian
and failed.</p>

<p>“In my bitter humiliation I felt I could not face
the sensation of tomorrow. I went out and threw myself
beneath the wheels of a passing trolley car to end
my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God, Viola!”</p>

<p>“It is the truth that I am telling you; and my life’s
story would have ended then and there but that a
passing stranger darted forward, and at the risk of
his own noble life snatched me from a terrible death.
It was Rolfe Maxwell, and with gentle sympathy he
drew from me the story of my sorrows, and my futile
plan for saving myself from the next day’s sensation
by marrying Florian. Then he threw himself into the
breach, offered marriage, owning that he loved me.
Now I will tell you what I have never confessed to any
living soul before: I accepted his offer, and at that
moment my whole heart went out to him in a fullness
of passion and devotion such as never had any part
in the lukewarm emotion I felt once for Florian and
for you afterward. I realized suddenly that I had
never really loved you and did not now regret you,
but that the fullness of love and happiness awaited
me with the man who had so nobly saved my young
life from shipwreck, earning my love and gratitude
at one stroke. My great mistake was that I was
ashamed to confess the truth to him then, and he
made the chivalrous mistake of leaving me free till
I could grow to care for him, going at once to Cuba,
where he soon met his tragic death.”</p>

<p class="center">STARTLING NEWS.</p>


<p>Viola paused with quivering lips, the tears hanging
heavily on the curling fringe of her long black lashes.
How beautiful, how unattainable, she looked to the
man who had loved and lost her in so strange a fashion,
who had only himself to blame for the thorn in his
heart!</p>

<p>A long, labored sigh heaved his breast, and smote
reproachfully on her ears.</p>

<p>She murmured, faintly:</p>

<p>“Is there not some one else you can love? Florian
soon found consolation.”</p>

<p>“I am not Florian. There will never be any one
else for me to love but you, Viola. I can not change,”
he answered, heavily, out of the despair in his heart.</p>

<p>“I am very, very sorry, but I can not give you any
hope,” she repeated, gently; and he rose to go, so haggard
and wan that it went to her heart, and she cried,
remorsefully: “Oh, I have been most cruel to you!
I led you on, or you never could have loved me, despising
coquettes as you did with all the strength of
your noble nature. But I have repented all my follies,
and I am a new Viola now, hating myself for all I
did, and most of all for wronging you so deeply I dare
not ask you to forgive me,” generously taking all the
blame to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“We all make mistakes in the course of our lives.
I forgive you everything, poor child,” he answered,
generously going up to her and taking her hands in a
lingering pressure, as he added, sorrowfully: “My
dream is over. God bless you, and farewell!”</p>

<p>He turned away with an aching heart and left her
weeping, with her fatally lovely face hidden in her
hands—weeping for him out of the pity of her heart.</p>

<p>“He was so noble after all, and perhaps if I had
married him I never should have realized that I was
capable of a deeper emotion than the gentle affection
I felt for him,” she thought; then her mind wandered
to the dead, and she sobbed, miserably, yearningly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Rolfe, my darling, could you but return and
know how I have loved you all the while!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Judge Van Lew and his sister had retired
to the library and were perusing the evening
papers, having felt it best to leave Viola alone with
her lover, feeling that a reconciliation would take
place.</p>

<p>Suddenly Aunt Edwina started and leaned across
the table, putting her shaking finger on a paragraph
in her paper, while she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Edmund, read this!”</p>

<p>He obeyed, and then they stared at each other with
ashen faces.</p>

<p>“Can it be true?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Very likely. And I should hope so if it were for
her happiness; but what a time for it to happen, just
as she is making up with Desha!” half groaned the
judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Ought we to go and tell them now?” she asked,
nervously.</p>

<p>“No; let us wait till he is gone, and break it as
gently as possible. Poor Viola, will she be glad or
sorry, I wonder?” mused the judge, and his sister answered,
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“To judge from the way she has carried on, I
should say glad; but still I believe it was all for effect
and to punish Desha. Why, there he is going
now!” she added, starting up from her seat.</p>

<p>“Then you can take the paper and show her the
paragraph, Edwina,” suggested her brother.</p>

<p>“Not me! You must break it to her yourself,” she
insisted; and the upshot of it was that they went presently
together to Viola, who dashed away the lingering
tears and turned to meet them with a pensive smile.</p>

<p>The judge began with a sorry attempt at cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“I—er—so I suppose you and Professor Desha have
been making it up, dear?”</p>

<p>To his relief she answered, frankly:</p>

<p>“I have passed through a very unpleasant scene,
papa. He came to offer me his hand again.”</p>

<p>“And you—you accepted,” he began, nervously.</p>

<p>“No, papa, I refused him. I found out long ago
that it was but a passing fancy I had for him, and
that if my poor Rolfe had lived I could have loved
him more than any other man I ever knew,” Viola
answered, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Then you will be very glad to read this paragraph,
my dear,” the judge exclaimed, gayly, pointing
it out to her with a shaking finger.</p>

<p class="center">BON VOYAGE.</p>


<p>Viola saw that her father was deeply agitated over
something, and cried out, excitedly:</p>

<p>“What is it, papa?”</p>

<p>“Read it, my dear, read it for yourself!” rejoined
the judge, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Read it, my dear!” echoed her aunt, earnestly.</p>

<p>Viola’s eyes were so dim with the tears she had
copiously shed out of sympathy with Philip Desha
that at first she could scarcely see the lines, they wavered
so before her gaze. She wiped them with her soft
lace handkerchief, and made another effort to read
the short paragraph that ran as follows:</p>

<p>“The vigorous Cuban policy of the new administration
has resulted in setting free many American citizens
long-imprisoned in Spanish dungeons, on false
charges, and a strange story comes from one of these
released men that the reported death of one of our famous
war correspondents, Rolfe Maxwell by name, is
untrue, and that the young man still lives a prisoner
<i>incommunicado</i> in Morro Castle. Public opinion is
greatly stirred up over this report, and Consul-General
Lee, at Havana, will be asked to effect young Maxwell’s
release at once.”</p>

<p>A loud and thrilling cry—a cry of rapture—rang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
through the room, and then Viola, faint from excess
of joy, clung to her father’s arm.</p>

<p>“Quick, Edwina, she will faint!” exclaimed her
father, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, no, papa!” gasped Viola, eagerly; “no, no;
I am too happy to faint! Oh, can this be true?”</p>

<p>“Do not build too strongly on it, dear, for newspaper
reports are not always reliable, and I know
nothing of this except the paragraph that you have
just read,” replied the judge, holding her tenderly on
his arm and stroking back her dark tresses that had
fallen in disorder over her white brow.</p>

<p>“But, papa, this must be looked into at once. Can
not you have an investigation made? Or—are you
sorry that there is a chance of Rolfe’s living yet? You
sent him away from me, you know!” the poor girl
cried out, in an agony of doubt and hope commingled.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew knew he deserved the reproach, and
he flushed up to his hair as he answered:</p>

<p>“Darling, I wronged Rolfe Maxwell when I sent
him from you as I did, but no one could be more anxious
to undo a wrong than I am now, and I shall
have this report fully investigated, and if possible your
noble young husband shall be speedily restored to you
with my blessing on your union. Can you find it in
your heart to forgive me then, my child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, I forgave you long ago, for you did it
for my sake, believing it would insure my happiness.
Now that you are reconciled to my marriage and willing
to help me find my husband, all is atoned for at
once. But what shall we do? Where shall we begin?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
demanded Viola, with feverish eagerness, her great
eyes shining like stars in her pale, excited face.</p>

<p>Her father was almost as much agitated as she was,
and after a moment’s thought, answered, tenderly:</p>

<p>“I think I will go on the first train to New York to
see the editor in whose paper this story appears, and
get all the facts I can so as to bring the case to the attention
of our Secretary of State, and enlist his kind
offices to have Maxwell released at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are to me, papa! I love you
more than ever!” cried Viola, clinging to his neck and
covering his face with kisses in the exuberance of her
joy, for after the long, dark night of sorrow and despair,
this little gleam of hope was like the sunshine
itself.</p>

<p>An hour later her father was en route for New
York, eagerly interested in his mission, and most anxious
to do all he could to restore peace and happiness
to Viola’s heart.</p>

<p>As for her, she could not sleep for hours. She spent
the night reclining on a low couch drawn near to
Rolfe’s portrait, where her eyes could rest on it every
time they opened from wakeful dozing.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it true—is it true, my darling? Do you really
live?” she cried over and over to the silent portrait,
whose dark eyes seemed to rest on her in passionate
love.</p>

<p>She knew it was almost silly, talking thus to an
insensate portrait, but she could not restrain the words
of tenderness, falling from her lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, my handsome, dark-eyed love, is
it indeed true that you live? Shall I see you again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
and will you love me still as you did that night when
your saving love came between me and utter despair?
Will you listen to my cry for forgiveness and love,
and be happy that we are reunited forever?”</p>

<p>Then Viola would weep tender, indignant tears to
think of the long months that Rolfe had lain in the
Spanish prison, an innocent victim, denied all communication
with the outside world, his friends believing
him dead, while he suffered tortures perhaps worse
than death.</p>

<p>Again she would kneel down and besiege Heaven
with fervent prayers for Rolfe’s restoration to her
yearning heart. At length she fell into a fitful repose
that lasted till morning; but at the moment she
finished breakfast she hastened to the cottage to carry
her good news to Mrs. Maxwell and Mae.</p>

<p>After all, it did not amount to much, that brief little
newspaper report. There might not be a word of
truth in it; but what joy it brought to their fond, loving
hearts, and how they rejoiced to each other, building
a whole world of splendid anticipations on Rolfe’s
return. It was like a rift of light in the black darkness
of a great despair, and Mae could be unselfishly
glad now too, since she was happy in the love of another.</p>

<p>Indeed, Florian came to call while Viola was there,
and was speedily told the good news, whereat he unselfishly
rejoiced with the rest.</p>

<p>Indeed, sweet, gentle Mae had so crept into his
heart that he no longer envied Rolfe Maxwell the prize
of Viola’s love. He wished her every happiness, but
his secret sympathies went out to Philip Desha, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
whom he had made friends only yesterday, and had
been told frankly that he was going to try again for
Viola’s heart.</p>

<p>It was late that night when Judge Van Lew returned
from New York, but Viola was sitting up for
him, too restless and agitated to retire until he came.</p>

<p>It went to his heart, the pale look of anxiety on the
lovely face as she glided toward him, and he cried out,
reassuringly:</p>

<p>“Cheer up, darling; I have goods news for you!”</p>

<p>He took her little cold hands in his, and kissed her
tenderly, as he added:</p>

<p>“It is almost certain that Rolfe Maxwell is alive,
a prisoner <i>incommunicado</i> in Morro Castle. The newspaper
that he wrote for has very reliable news from a
recently released prisoner, and steps have already been
taken to secure his release. Consul-General Lee was
cabled to yesterday to give immediate attention to the
case.”</p>

<p>Viola’s head rested against his shoulder, her form
shaking with sobs of joy.</p>

<p>“How long, papa, how long?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Until his release?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We hope it will be immediate, and if so, he ought
to reach Havana in a very few days, en route for
home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, may I not go and meet him there?”
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Dearest, it would not be prudent,” the father said,
hesitatingly; adding, after a moment’s thought: “Send
me in your place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Papa, would you indeed be so kind?” cried Viola,
astonished and delighted.</p>

<p>“I would do anything for your happiness, my dear
child,” returned the judge, who never did anything
by halves, and was in deep earnest now in his desire
to help Viola.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, papa, thank you a thousand times,
and please don’t think me troublesome, but—but—oh,
papa, let us go together to Cuba, you and I, dear, and
meet poor Rolfe and bring him home,” coaxed Viola.</p>

<p>Judge Van Lew would have preferred to leave his
daughter at home with her aunt, but she would listen
to neither argument nor persuasion; her whole heart
was set on going, and as a result of her determination,
he sailed for Cuba next day, taking her as his
companion.</p>

<p class="center">“AS FLIES THE DOVE TO SEEK ITS MATE.”</p>


<p>How long the journey seemed to Viola ere they
gained at last the beautiful Cuban shores, now, alas!
laid waste by cruel, devastating war!</p>

<p>By reason of a railway accident that belated them
twenty-four hours in a Floridian town, they did not
reach Havana till the fifth day.</p>

<p>Then, weary and impatient, they took quarters at the
best hotel, and the judge, leaving his daughter to rest
in her rooms, went out at once in search of news of
Maxwell.</p>

<p>Viola was too eager and impatient to rest long, now
that she seemed to have attained the goal of her desires.</p>

<p>She could think of nothing but the longed-for reunion
with the husband of an hour, from whom she
had been so long and cruelly parted, believing him
dead and herself widowed.</p>

<p>She glanced at her black gown, rejoicing that she
should so soon be able to lay it aside for the bright
robes of happiness.</p>

<p>Aunt Edwina had wished her to lay her mourning
aside before leaving, but she had demurred.</p>

<p>“I wish my husband to see me first in the garb of
woe, then he will know how truly I have mourned
him,” she said, wondering if Rolfe would not be proud
and glad to learn that she had loved him all the while.</p>

<p>She had not waited more than an hour before her
father returned with such a radiant face that she
knew before he spoke he brought good news.</p>

<p>“Dear papa!” she cried, inquiringly, springing up
to meet him.</p>

<p>“Viola, we are fortunate, most fortunate, in our
quest. Rolfe Maxwell has been set free, and arrived
in Havana this very morning!” he exclaimed, gladly.</p>

<p>“Dear Heaven, I thank Thee!” she cried, fervently,
tears of wild joy starting to her brilliant, upraised
eyes, while she trembled violently with joyful emotion.</p>

<p>To have loved and lost, and to find again, what
rapture! Will not this be one of the supremest joys
of Heaven when we “cross the moaning bar” and
find waiting for us on the golden shore the dear ones
who went from us through the dark portals of death
to endless life?</p>

<p>It was joy akin to this that thrilled Viola at her
father’s words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>Reading through his tenderness her yearning
thought, the judge continued:</p>

<p>“I have prepared a pleasant surprise for your husband,
Viola. I have sent a messenger to bring him
here to us, simply saying that some American friends
long very much to see him.”</p>

<p>“Then he will be coming—directly!” gasped Viola,
dizzy with joy.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, and I shall give directions to have him
come directly to your private parlor, so that you can
receive him first alone, as naturally that will be most
proper,” added the judge, kindly.</p>

<p>Viola could not speak for emotion; she could only
look her fervent gratitude as he turned to the door,
saying:</p>

<p>“Now make yourself as lovely as possible, and I
will send you word as soon as he comes.”</p>

<p>Viola changed her plain traveling-gown for a soft,
lusterless black silk, with touches of filmy white at
throat and wrists, then sat down to wait in wild impatience,
her heart throbbing fiercely, her cheeks
glowing, her eyes brilliant with tenderness, her beauty
almost unearthly in its splendor of joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly a servant appeared at the door, saying:</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell is waiting in your private parlor to
see you.”</p>

<p>Viola leaped to her feet and flew to the room, impatience
urging her like wings.</p>

<p>In the elegant apartment she saw a tall figure standing
at the window, with its face turned away, the fine
head crowned with waves of soft dark hair.</p>

<p>“Rolfe, dear Rolfe!” she cried out, in a tempest of
feeling.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">“HOPE DEFERRED MAKETH THE HEART SICK.”</p>


<p>The man at the window turned about with a quick
start and faced Viola.</p>

<p>His delighted eyes fell upon the most rarely beautiful
girl he had ever seen, her great eyes starry with
joy, her cheeks and lips abloom with excitement that
set all her lovely dimples into play with welcoming
smiles as she eagerly advanced to him, crying, excitedly:</p>

<p>“Rolfe, dear Rolfe!”</p>

<p>But, oh, what a sudden and terrible change came
over that lovely face in an instant, turning all its
radiance to gloom, as the twilight suddenly settles
over a landscape but a moment since flooded with the
golden glory of sunset!</p>

<p>It all came in an instant as she looked up into the
face above her—the face of a handsome man, pale
and wan with the prison pallor, and lighted by dark
eyes gleaming out of hollow orbits—yet the face of
an utter stranger, whose expression was one of keen
surprise mixed with irrepressible admiration.</p>

<p>Viola comprehended that there had been some mistake,
and made an effort to pull herself together, drawing
back, and exclaiming, coldly:</p>

<p>“I—I—really, there must be some mistake! I expected
to see Rolfe Maxwell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>The stranger answered, respectfully:</p>

<p>“There is no mistake, Miss——. Pardon me, I do
not know your name. I was sent for to come to this
hotel to meet some American friends who longed to
see me.”</p>

<p>“I sent the message; but you are not the Rolfe
Maxwell I wished to see. Can there be two of the
same name?” faltered Viola, with blanching cheeks.</p>

<p>“Not that I am aware of, Miss——” he began; and
she supplied the name:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Maxwell.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mrs. Maxwell!” He started, and added: “Perhaps
a relative of the man you are seeking!”</p>

<p>“His wife—or widow!” groaned Viola, staggering
to a chair and sinking into it, her lovely face convulsed
with despair, as she thought:</p>

<p>“Oh, what if there has been some terrible mistake
after all, and he, my love, is indeed dead, while I have
come this wretched journey all in vain!”</p>

<p>The greatest enemy she had in the wide world might
have pitied her drooping so forlornly in her chair like
a lovely flower snapped suddenly from its brittle stem.</p>

<p>The heart of the stranger yearned over her with
manly sympathy, and he said, gently:</p>

<p>“I was released but a few days ago from Morro
Castle, where I have been imprisoned almost a year
by the Spanish on false charges, and threatened with
death on my trial, which, fortunately for me, never
took place, my release being peremptorily demanded
by the new administration of the United States. Is
this the Rolfe Maxwell you wished to find?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes, but I tell you there is a strange mistake—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
mystery about this matter. I came here hoping
to find my husband, Rolfe Maxwell, a war correspondent,
who was reported shot long months ago.
After mourning him as dead, a paragraph recently
appeared in a newspaper stating that he still lived, a
prisoner in Morro Castle. On my father investigating
the rumor, he learned that the editors of this powerful
paper had already interested the Government at
Washington in securing his release. We came here,
papa and I, to meet him and take him home with us,”
explained Viola, eagerly, in the faint hope of having
him throw some light on the mystery.</p>

<p>She was right, for after a moment’s hesitancy, the
spurious Rolfe Maxwell answered:</p>

<p>“If I could see your father, I could tell him some
facts that would throw a new light on this mystery.”</p>

<p>Viola rose and touched the bell, saying to the boy
who answered it:</p>

<p>“Ask Judge Van Lew to come in here.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes her father appeared, his smile on
entering changing to surprise at sight of a stranger.</p>

<p>“Papa, this gentleman is Rolfe Maxwell, but not the
one we expected to find,” explained Viola, heart-brokenly.</p>

<p>The two men shook hands with each other, and
the judge courteously offered a chair to the stranger,
who said:</p>

<p>“I will accept it, thank you, for I have a story to
tell you of some moment regarding this lady’s husband.
But perhaps she had better withdraw; the
conclusion may be too sad for her hearing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>But Viola only drew her chair closer to her father,
and clung to his arm, faltering:</p>

<p>“Let me stay, and I will try to bear the shock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let her stay,” Judge Van Lew answered, with
a world of tenderness and sympathy, as he turned
his eyes on the wan and wasted yet noble countenance
of the young man.</p>

<p>And his first words startled them very much:</p>

<p>“I shall have to confess right in the beginning that
for long months I have been masquerading under a
false name, having, in fact, exchanged names with the
man you are seeking.”</p>

<p>Viola and her father both exclaimed aloud in astonishment,
and the young man continued:</p>

<p>“Yet I beg you to believe that I have done no
wrong. It was a fair exchange made by mutual agreement.”</p>

<p>“But where is he now—my husband?” cried Viola,
anxiously.</p>

<p>The stranger turned a pitying gaze on the lovely,
anxious face, and said, gently:</p>

<p>“Please be patient with me, dear madame, and I will
come to that presently.”</p>

<p>He had suffered untold horrors in the past months
in the dreadful prison where his young life had been
wasting away, but he would almost rather have endured
another month of imprisonment than pierce her
gentle heart with the story he had to tell.</p>

<p>When he remembered the beauty and gladness of
her face as she first entered the room, and the sad
change he saw upon it now, he realized how dearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
she had loved Rolfe Maxwell, and how the end of
his story would blast her heart.</p>

<p>“God help her to bear the sorrow she has come
so far to meet!” he thought, wishing that he had such
a beautiful love to welcome him on his return home.</p>

<p>“Tell me as quickly as you can! I can not bear
this cruel suspense longer!” Viola cried to him entreatingly,
her lily hands, on one of which the gleaming
wedding-ring shone so brightly clasped convulsively
across her wildly throbbing heart.</p>

<p>The stranger sighed as he turned his hollow eyes
on Viola’s pale face, replying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“I will hasten, for I know all the anguish of suspense
myself too well to inflict it on another, so
will go back to the time in April, 1896, when I first
made the acquaintance of Rolfe Maxwell, whom I envied
above all things for his newly achieved fame as
a great war correspondent.”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes!” breathed Viola, eagerly, her deep
eyes burning on his face as he continued:</p>

<p>“In March a year ago I came from my home in
Florida to Cuba with the intention of enlisting in the
army to fight for the freedom of that fair isle of the
sea, but owing to a physical defect, an organic weakness
of the heart, I was not accepted. Through sheer
disappointment, I was quite ill for days afterward,
during which I made the acquaintance of Rolfe Maxwell,
whom I admired and envied equally as a journalist
who had leaped into sudden but well-deserved
fame as the capable correspondent of a leading newspaper
in New York.</p>

<p>“He was so kind to me in my illness that we became
great friends, and confidential enough for me
to suspect that the brilliant, versatile young man had
suffered some crushing disappointment in love that had
embittered his cheerful nature to the verge of despair.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” breathed Viola, while her father stifled a
sigh of keen self-reproach for the fatal blunder he
had made in parting Rolfe and Viola.</p>

<p>The stranger sighed in sympathy, and went on with
his story:</p>

<p>“Finding that I could not enlist in the army, my
next ambition was to become a correspondent, so as
to let my pen at least be employed in defending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
cause of the heroic revolutionists, whom I regarded
as the noblest, most injured of men.</p>

<p>“But even here I was balked in my aspirations, the
journalistic field being so fully covered that no opening
was left for me, dooming me to inaction, while my
whole soul burned with fiery ardor in Cuba’s cause.</p>

<p>“At this juncture Rolfe Maxwell came to my aid
with a startling proposition that we should change
names, he resigning to me his journalistic position and
enlisting in the army, for which his education at
West Point, his sympathy with the Cubans, and his
reckless state of mind equally fitted him. Indeed, he
confessed to me that his preference was the army, and
that he should have entered it on first coming to Cuba
but for the thought of his widowed mother, who
would have grieved unceasingly.</p>

<p>“‘I will own to you, my friend, that I have a secret,
intolerable sorrow that goads me to despair,’ he said
to me, with a sadness that made my heart ache in
sympathy. ‘I wedded the most lovely and charming
girl on earth, only to find that she came to regret the
bonds that fettered us, and to wish herself free. I
swear to you that the dearest wish of my heart is to
end my hopeless pain by a brave and honorable death
on the field of battle.’”</p>

<p>Viola, unable to control her emotion, burst into a
fit of passionate sobbing, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, there was a terrible mistake that wrecked
both our lives, and he went away too soon in his
rash pride to find out the real truth that I loved him
with the same tenderness he bore to me. But now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
alas! ’tis too late! He will never know how well I
loved him! You are going to tell me he is dead!”</p>

<p>“My story is almost ended,” he answered, evasively,
as she stifled her bursting sobs, permitting him to
proceed:</p>

<p>“Our arrangements for the harmless fraud we proposed
were easily made, and I will not enter into them,
thus protracting your suspense. Suffice it to say that I
can not understand why you did not learn that he still
lived after his reported shooting, as it was planned
he should still write his mother under his own name.
Perhaps his letters went astray, and were not received.
Anyway, he went into the army and distinguished himself
under my name, while I, within two weeks, and
just as I was earning welcome laurels as a correspondent,
was arrested and thrown into prison under
his pseudonym. There I remained until this week, denied
all communication with the world outside my
dungeon door, expecting to be shot any time at day-break,
with the hundreds whose death-knells each
morning echoed dismally across the water, announcing
the dawn of a new day, and feeling myself already
as dead as if the grave had closed over me. That
is all, except that on my release from prison I learned
that Rolfe Maxwell, under my name of Arthur Linwood,
had earned the rank of captain in the Cuban
army, and covered himself with glory.”</p>

<p>“Linwood—Captain Linwood!” almost shrieked
Viola, who had read so often of the brave young
American whose deeds of daring on many a hard-fought
field had won the plaudits of the admiring
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Captain Linwood,” repeated Arthur Linwood;
adding: “The Cubans fairly worship this gallant
hero, who has risked his life so often to serve
their cause, and I am told that America also is proud
of her gallant son. When I go home tomorrow his
countrymen shall hear through their favorite newspaper
the whole story of his identity and of my release.
It is a story that will thrill their hearts with
pride and sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Sorrow?” echoed Viola, with a convulsive start;
and he answered, reluctantly:</p>

<p>“The saddest part of my story must be told now.
You may have heard of the recent terrible fighting
in the Province of Santa Clara. Well, the news from
the battle-field yesterday reported Captain Linwood as
mortally wounded.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“She left her home, she lost her pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Forgot the jeering world—ah, me!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And followed a knight who fought and bled</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All for the sake of—chivalry.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Viola did not cry out in despair and faint and fall
as they foreboded—she simply bowed her face upon
her father’s arm in a silence more terrible and fatal
than the wildest grief—the silence of a fond heart
breaking in the awful revulsion from hope to despair.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other in silent sympathy;
then the judge said, hopefully:</p>

<p>“Sometimes these reports from the battle-field are
exaggerated—sometimes totally false, as in the case of
your reported death. Perhaps this may prove a
<i>cannard</i>.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope so,” said Arthur Linwood; adding:
“I was about to suggest that we make further investigations
before we give up hope, and as you will not
wish to leave your daughter just now, permit me to
go and find out if possible the real truth of the matter,
which I will report to you as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>The judge was only too glad to avail himself of
the kindness of the noble young man who already
seemed like an old friend, his connection with Rolfe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Maxwell forming a bond of union between their
hearts.</p>

<p>Arthur Linwood bowed himself out, casting back
a sympathetic glance at the beautiful bowed head of
the hapless girl who knew not whether to call herself
wife or widow.</p>

<p>He thought, enthusiastically:</p>

<p>“It is no wonder that Maxwell told me he had married
the most beautiful and charming woman in the
world. I have never seen any one to compare with
her for beauty and grace, though I have traveled over
half the world, and seen many beauties in my time.
I am glad she told me so soon that she was married,
for my head was in a whirl as soon as I saw
her radiant face, and I should have been seas over
in love in ten minutes if I had not found out so soon
that the case would be hopeless. But now, I pray
Heaven, that the news may not be true, and that Maxwell
may live for the happiness awaiting him in his
young bride’s love. It must have been a terrible mistake
that parted them, for if ever I read devotion on a
woman’s face it shone on hers in that moment when
she met me, believing I was her husband.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Viola and her father remained at their
hotel, waiting in the keenest suspense for news, until
some hours later when he returned.</p>

<p>“The report is unfortunately true,” he said, sorrowfully.
“Poor Rolfe is indeed badly wounded, and the
impression is that he must die. But cheer up, my
friends, for you know the old saying, while there’s life
there’s hope. I have learned that Rolfe has been
brought from the battle-field to a hospital near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Havana, and I consider it a hopeful sign that he was
able to bear the journey. Now I believe that with the
aid of the Consul-General we may be permitted to visit
the hospital.”</p>

<p>Viola looked up and spoke the first sentence she had
uttered for hours.</p>

<p>“Oh, for sweet pity’s sake, let us hasten the arrangements!”
she cried, feverishly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Captain Linwood, the young American hero, or
Rolfe Maxwell, as we shall henceforth know him, lay
with half-closed, dark, weary eyes on his cot in the
hospital ward, thinking half regretfully of what the
surgeon on his afternoon round had just said to him:</p>

<p>“Cheer up, my lad, cheer up! You’re worth a
dozen dead men yet. I’m just going out to send a
report to the newspapers that the story of your being
mortally wounded is all bosh. A young fellow
with a splendid physique like yours is not going to die
of some severe scratches and an arm broken in two
places by bullets because he waved the Cuban flag so
high in the enemy’s face. I’ll own that you’re disabled
from fighting for many months to come. But what of
that? You need a rest, and if you recuperate fast,
you can go home to your friends in a few weeks, and
there’s still a sound arm to embrace your best girl with,
ha! ha! Come now, brighten up, I say! You don’t
show as much pluck in bearing pain as you did in
facing the enemy; but you’ve got to cultivate cheerfulness
just to aid your recovery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>He went away rather anxious over his patient’s settled
despondency, and Rolfe lay ruminating with a
feverish flush on his cheeks and a hopeless sorrow in
his fine dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, if he only knew how little I care to get well,
and that both arms might as well have been broken,
for they will never again embrace a woman’s form
in love. Why did not the Spanish soldiers give me
release in the midst of battle from this torture of life?
Must I indeed recover in spite of myself when I
would rather die, even though I know she would not
shed one tear when she heard that my heart was still
at last—the heart that loved her fatally and too well?”</p>

<p>Some familiar lines he had often read seemed to
float mockingly through his weary brain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I go—and she doth miss me not!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall I die, and be forgot—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgot as is some sorrow past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or cloud by fleeting sickness cast.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Death and the all-absorbing tomb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will hide me in eternal gloom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she will live—as gay—alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As though I had been never known.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He closed his heavy eyes as soft footsteps and the
flutter of a woman’s robe came down the ward between
the rows of white beds. Some one suddenly
knelt beside his narrow cot.</p>

<p>“A kind Sister of Charity to pray for me,” he
thought; but a soft hand fell on his head caressingly,
and tears splashed down hotly on his wasted cheek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“Rolfe, my darling husband!” sobbed a tender voice,
and his eyes flashed open wildly.</p>

<p>“Viola! Is this a dream?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not a dream, my darling. It is your wife,
Viola, your true, loving wife. Do not be excited, dear,
for the good doctor said I must be careful, lest the
happiness of seeing me might agitate you too much.
Be quiet, dear, for I will do all the talking after you
have just said you will forgive me for causing you so
much sorrow. But I have so much to tell you, and the
first thing is this: Papa made a great mistake, for I
loved you all the while, and we shall never be parted
again!” sealing the promise with a tender, lingering
kiss.</p>
